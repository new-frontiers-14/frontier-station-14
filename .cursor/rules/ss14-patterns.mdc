# Your rule content

- Do not apply NetworkedComponent or AutoGenerateComponentState to server side components.
- Do not make server systems or components inherit from their shared counterparts. Components should inherit "Component" and systems should inherit from "EntitySystem" unless otherwise specified.
- Use AppearanceSystem.TryGetData() rather than ApperanceData directly.
- Use primary constructors.
- Components are containers for data and should never have any logic.
- DataFields shouldn't have private data.
- Use ViewVariables attributes in server side components.
- Prefer simple comments over xml tags
- Use the Entity<T> ent, ref event args pattern for event handling.
