    type: Tweak
  - message: Flare guns are twice as likely to appear in emergency closets, with the
      same rarity as MRE's.
    type: Tweak
  - message: Added the security shell gun, a modified flare gun which is capable of
      handling both nonlethal and lethal shotgun shells. It is able to be crafted
