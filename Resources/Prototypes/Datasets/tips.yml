  - "As an Engineer, you can electrify grilles by placing powered cables beneath them."
  - "As an Engineer, you can use plasma glass to reinforce an area and prevent radiation. Uranium glass can also be used to prevent radiation."

  - "As the Captain, you have absolute access and control over the station, but this does not mean that being a horrible person won't result in mutiny."

  - "As a Medical Doctor, don't underestimate your cryo pods! They heal almost every type of damage, making them very useful when you are overloaded or need to heal someone in a pinch."
  - "As a Medical Doctor, excise caution when putting reptilians in cryopods. They will take a lot of extra cold damage, but you can mitigate this with some burn medicine or leporazine."

  - "You can put napalm in a backpack water tank to make a flamethrower."
  - "Some jobs have alternate uniforms in their respective drobe vendors. Don't be afraid to try out a new look!"

  - "Just because a job can't be a traitor at the beginning of a round doesn't mean that they'll never be a traitor."

  - "Zombies are very vunerable to heat damage, making welding tools and laser guns extremely effective against them."
  - "You can weld glass shards into glass sheets."
  - "By right clicking on a player, and then clicking the heart icon, you can quickly examine them to check for injuries or how badly they're bleeding. You can also do this to yourself."
  - "Monkeys have a rare chance to be sentient. Ook!"
  - "You can tell if an area with firelocks up is spaced by looking to see if the firelocks have lights besides them."
