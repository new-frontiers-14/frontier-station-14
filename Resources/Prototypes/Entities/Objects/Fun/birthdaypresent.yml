      [head=3]It has come to our attention that Nanotrasen's operations in the Frontier Sector have reached an anniversary recently.

      As a celebration, we have enclosed a complimentary slice of cake and party hat.

      Take some time to enjoy the occasion, and thank you for helping make the Frontier what it is.[/head]

                              [head=2]Now get back to work.[/head]
