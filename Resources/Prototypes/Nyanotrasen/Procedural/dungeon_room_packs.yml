## SIZE-TAGGING
#
# I'm doing a little black magic here.
#
# Every area below is 27x27 which is a specific size, used like a namespace,
# because we don't have ways to specify the spawning of certain tagged rooms in
# room packs. Inside each of these 27x27 room packs is a set of rooms according
# to a certain format.
#
# 3xY rooms are hallways.
# 4x4 rooms are maintenance.
# 5x5 rooms are general facilities.
# 6x5 rooms are offices.
# 7x7 rooms are larger, specialized facilities.
#
# The 8x5 room is a generator.
# The 9x7 room is a larger variant of a specialized facility.
#
# There's some overlap with what is what, but that's the general trend.
#
# Now, this will cease to work as I intended if another 27x27 area is added
# which does not conform to the room sizes that the others have, which is why I
# chose such a large and odd number.
#
# Wizard's Den will hopefully never add another area set of the same size.
#
# In the future, room pack namespaces should probably have large, uneven sizes
# to ensure this. It is sufficient to add or subtract one pixel to create a new
# namespace.
#
# I will likely make more comprehensive size-tagged room pack namespaces in the
# future. This was my first foray into dungeon generation.
