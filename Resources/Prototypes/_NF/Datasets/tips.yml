  - "As a ghost, you can use the Verb Menu to orbit around and follow any entity in game automatically."
  - "You can examine your headset to see which radio channels you have available and how to speak in them."
  - "As a Salvage Technician, you can use your proto-kinetic accelerator to move yourself in space when in a pinch. Just be weary that it isn't very effective."
  - "As the Bartender, try experimenting with unique drinks. Have you tried to make demon's blood yet?"
  - "As a Botanist, you can mutate and crossbreed plants together to create more potent produce that also has higher yields."
  - "As the Lawyer, try to negotiate with the Bailiff if sentences seem too high for the crime."
  - "As a NFSD Member, communicate and coordinate with your fellow officers using the NFSD radio channel to avoid confusion."
  - "As a NFSD Member, remember that correlation does not equal causation. Someone may have just been at the wrong place at the wrong time!"

  - "As a Medical Doctor, try to be wary of overdosing your patients, especially if someone else has already been on the scene. Overdoses are often lethal to patients in crit!"
  - "As a Medical Doctor, remember that your health analyzer has a replacable battery. If it drains too quickly for your taste, you can ask science to print a better battery for you!"
  - "As a Chemist, once you've made everything you've needed to, don't be afraid to make more silly reagents. Have you tried desoxyephedrine?"
  - "Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether from your peers in character or through LOOC, or from admins!"
  - "You'll quickly lose your interest in the game if you play to win and kill. If you find yourself doing this, take a step back and talk to people--it's a much better experience!"
  - "We were all new once, be patient and guide new players, especially those playing intern roles, in the right direction."
  - "Firesuits, winter coats and emergency EVA suits offer mild protection from the cold, allowing you to spend longer periods of time near breaches and space than if wearing nothing at all."
  - "In an emergency, you can always rely on firesuits and emergency EVA suits; they will always spawn in their respective lockers. They might be awkward to move around in, but can easily save your life in a dangerous situation."
  - "In an emergency, remember that you can craft improvised weapons! A baseball bat or spear could easily mean the difference between deterring an attacker or perishing from the hands of one."

  - "You can put napalm in a backpack water tank to make a flamethrower."
  - "Speed is almost everything in combat. Using hardsuits just for their armor is usually a terrible idea unless the resistances it provides are geared towards combat, or you're not planning to go head-first into the fray."
  - "You can spray a fire extinguisher, throw items or fire a gun while floating through space to give yourself a minor boost. Simply fire opposite to where you want to go."

  - "You can climb onto a table by dragging yourself onto one."
  - "You can move an item out of the way by dragging it, and then holding CTRL + right click and moving your mouse into the direction you want it to go."

  - "Bleeding is no joke! If you've been shot or acquired any other major injury, make sure to treat it quickly."
  - "In an emergency, you can butcher a jumpsuit with a sharp object to get cloth, which can be crafted into gauze."
  - "You can use sharp objects to butcher clothes or animals in the right click context menu. This includes glass shards."

  - "You can weld glass shards into glass sheets."
  - "By right clicking on a player, and then clicking the heart icon, you can quickly examine them to check for injuries or how badly they're bleeding. You can also do this to yourself."
  - "Monkeys and kobolds have a rare chance to be sentient. Ook!"
  - "You can tell if an area with firelocks up is spaced by looking to see if the firelocks have lights beside them."
  - "Instead of picking it up, you can alt-click food to eat it. This also works for mice and other creatures without hands."
# Frontier
  - "Smaller shuttles offer greater maneuverability, while bigger ones offer a wider and better spectrum of services. Choose wisely!"
  - "If you're low on funds, try wandering into nearby ships and ask the local captains if they need a hand. Perhaps you can pick up a high-paying job!"
  - "It's often better to join an existing crew than to become a solo captain. It can teach you new things and give you a good sum of money."
  - "It's always better to have a crew than to stay alone in deep space. A friend can save your life if you make a mistake, or save you from trouble!"
  - "Scientists often sell interesting technologies that can assist you in your job. Perhaps you would want a bottomless bag that can fit an entire station?"
  - "As a scientist, you can sell your technologies to others. Many would want a bluespace bag, or a chemical dispenser."
  - "Felinids and other small people can sit in bags! Ask around - maybe there are feline friends seeking for a new home?"
  - "While holding a bag with 120 free space, you can force a small person inside. Be careful, they may get mad at you!"
  - "Staying in deep space induces severe stress and often leads to a sudden sleep disorder. You can hire an emotional support crewmember to help you overcome it!"

  - "The Vulpkanin will love you if you keep petting them."
  - "When you enter cryosleep, your body remains stored for up to 60 minutes! As a ghost, you can use the 'un-cryo' button to wake up and return to it!"
  - "If you accidentally left the game for a long time, you can still check on your character. Perhaps someone shoved them into a cryopod and you can use the 'un-cryo' button?"
  - "If you see a person who's fallen SSD, make sure to drag them to cryo and shove them into a cryopod. It will prevent them from dying, and will allow the player to return to the body later!"
  - "Vending machine food is bad for your health! Watch out for food trucks such as the Skipper or the McCargo - they can offer delicious food for a reasonable price!"
  - "Meals cooked by chefs are more filling, more flavorful, and in some cases can even boost your movement speed for a short time!"
  - "Each ID card can have a shuttle attached to it. If you need to purchase an additional shuttle, you can ask your local SR for another ID!"
  - "The Station Representative can rename your shuttle! Usually it's enough to hand your ID and ask them to do it."
  - "If your ship has a big crew, you can ask the SR for radio keys for your fellow crewmates. Some channels, such as Cargo or Science, are usually empty."
  - "Before joining an ongoing round, you can see the list of ships registered on the New Frontiers. Perhaps some of them have jobs you would prefer?"
  - "Don't forget to buy a medical implant before wandering into deep space! It will send a message to the local medics in the event of your death."
  - "As a medic, you should cooperate with others when there's a medical emergency! It never helps when two medical ships arrive at the same emergency signal."
  - "As a medic, you can ask the local SR for a medical PDA. It can double as a health analyzer!"
  - "Medical ships often have access to the hypospray. An experienced chemist can turn it into a lethal weapon, or use it to safely put people to sleep."
  - "If you're hurt, try to ask for medical help on the radio. Medics are often eager to heal the wounded, as their job usually gets boring after hours of waiting."
  - "Always carry a GPS with yourself! It can help you locate your station, or tell your location to others and get saved."
  - "Smuggling is very profitable, but also very risky! Remember to have an IFF console and hide your IFF before going for a dead drop."
  - "As a smuggler, try to destroy any evidence of your crimes. Remember, your PDA has a notepad app, which can be used to store important notes in a digital form."
  - "NFSD has a special IFF console that completely hides their ship on the radar! If you're an outlaw, watch out for those invisible Prowlers!"
  - "Certain ships can act as motherships. They have shipyard consoles, which allow you to purchase and sell other smaller ships!"
  - "Remember to check the space law book in your PDA. It contains some useful info, for example: you can start a mutiny if your captain is found to be in violation of the Space Law."
  - "Your PDA has a pre-installed news application. Check it out, perhaps the local reporter has posted some interesting news?"
  - "There's a special app installed in your PDA, which allows you to see posted bounties. If you can fulfill one of them, you can ask the local SR or Sheriff for a reward!"
  - "Remember, Frontier Outpost has a 200m wide safe-zone. It's forbidden to engage in antagonist behavior or damage property in any way within that limit!"
  - "If you're using an IFF console, remember to turn your IFF on near frontier, or you'll risk facing NFSD on your ship!"
  - "Going on an expedition alone is very risky! Make sure to always have a crewmate to save you in case you get ambushed by a xeno queen."
  - "Expeditions can yield rare and useful items, and not all of them are legal. Try not to leave those lying on the floor, as NFSD might board you at some point!"
  - "Sometimes there's a Station Traffic Controller on the frontier outpost. Make sure to contact them before docking, or you may face a fine!"
  - "Every crewmember starts with a traffic headset encryption key in their survival box. Make sure to use it to contact the STC before docking with the station!"
  - "If you get stranded in space, make sure to notify others using the radio! Getting depressed and falling into coma is usually not the best solution."
  - "Salvage is not just about whacking rocks. You can try to find large derelict stations, or try to bury deep into an unusual asteroid - but beware of the great dangers that may await you inside."
  - "Trust is something that takes ages to build, and seconds to lose. Don't give players and admins a reason to hate you!"
  - "There are multiple ways to earn money. You can try to get a job on frontier, join NFSD, go salvaging, do science, or do something totally illegal. Other players can teach you each one of them!"
