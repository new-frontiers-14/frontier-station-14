      [head=3]Official Party Preparation Procedure[/head]
        
      Thank you for purchasing your official, NT-approved party crate.

      The first step to any time-efficient party is preparedness. Make sure to consult a caterer or your NT Guidebook for a recipe to make a tasty cake.

      The next step is inviting guests. Make sure to find a happy medium between too few and too many people for an optimal morale boost. Be sure to fax or radio any prospective guests beforehand.

      Be sure to keep noise to a reasonable level, and do not engage in unnecessary carousing or drunkenness. Remember, hangovers are bad for both morale and profits. Find moderation in all things.

      Use the materials included to the best of your ability to entertain your guests. Ingenuity, resourcefulness, leadership and service are all critical to proper party procedure.

      Have fun! Remember to recycle all expended material upon party completion.
