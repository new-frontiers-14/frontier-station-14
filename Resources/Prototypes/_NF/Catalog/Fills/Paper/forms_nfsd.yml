      This document is a contract between the above Contraband Holder and Frontier Command.

      Any crimes of contraband possession for the Contraband Holder will be waived so long as all Class 3 contraband items, and any Class 2 contraband items not subject to a Class 2 Contraband Permit are turned in within reasonable time (subject to the clause below), and not used for malicious purposes. Noncompliance with this document results in voiding any standing Class 2 Contraband Permits.

      If the Contraband Holder is not paid in full at the above rate for any contraband turned in, they may remain in possession of the contraband without penalty at their discretion.

      [bold]Any contraband seized during operations aboard hostile vessels must be surrendered, either to the NFSD or the Station Representative, for a cash bounty. Failure to surrender contraband will lead to the forfeiture of this agreement, and the authorized party may be liable for criminal charges.[/bold]
        
      The authorized party is to keep a copy of this document for inspection. The authorized party is expected to maintain contact with NFSD command and/or the Station Representative to minimize casualties.
