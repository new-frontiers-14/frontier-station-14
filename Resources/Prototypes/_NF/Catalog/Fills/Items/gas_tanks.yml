# Moles calculation
#
#   moles = 1000 / (8.31446261 * 293.15 / volume)
#
#   More practically:
#
#   moles = volume * 0.41027581
#
#   Yes, you do need all those digits or your pressure wont end up exactly 1000
#
#
# The number 1000 comes from the default MaxReleasePressure for a GasCanister,
# which is 10 * Atmospherics.OneAtmosphere, rounded down.
#
# 8.31446261 is the universal gas constant
#
# 293.15 is our default atmospheric temperature
#

# If you change the mole amounts, you can calculate the new gas supply times with:
# minutes = (moles / outputPressure) * 325
