#These are intentionally all very mediocre as locational damage does not exist yet. Without it, armor values will stack in a way that makes it really god damn hard to determine how effective something is, along with making players extremely tanky.
#When it DOES exist, the values here should be totally reworked - probably just port them from SS13.
