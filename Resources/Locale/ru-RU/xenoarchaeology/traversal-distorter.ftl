traversal-distorter-set-in = Traversal bias set to "in"
traversal-distorter-set-out = Traversal bias set to "out"

traversal-distorter-desc-in = The affected artifact's traversal now favors moving inwards to the beginning.
traversal-distorter-desc-out = The affected artifact's traversal now favors moving outwards towards more dangerous nodes.

traversal-distorter-upgrade-bias = Bias effectiveness
