book-text-escalation = When it comes to getting robusted, it's all about strategy. Do it right and you'll be the envy of the station. Do it wrong and the gods themselves may turn against you. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        First things first: let the insults fly! This is your chance to really let your opponent know what you think of their ridiculously large shoes and that annoying bike horn.

        No conflict is complete without a little bit of physicality. Give your opponent a good shove or two, and if you're lucky, they'll stumble and fall, providing even more opportunities for insults.

        But beware, because by now your opponent is probably trying to kill you. So, try to calm things down a bit. It'll make you look good during the inevitable homicide investigation.

        If deescalation doesn't work, it's time to grab a weapon. But be smart about it - choose something that looks like it couldn't possibly be deadly, like this book.

        And if you're both still standing, it's time to pull out the big guns. Find the sharpest thing you can and end things, because everyone's getting kind of tired of this by now.

        Now parade your vanquished opponent through the halls to the medbay so that everyone knows just how robust you really are.

        Remember, it's all about conserving energy. Let your opponent do some of the escalation for you - it's a win-win!

book-text-escalation-security = Get it right and you'll have the whole station calling you shitsec. Get it wrong and you'll face harmbatoning from the gods. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        They say the pen is mightier than the sword, but you don't have a sword, you have a stun baton, and as soon as you start writing, any suspect is going to leave.

        So, try starting your confrontations with words. It probably won't get you called shitsec, but it's also not likely to be very effective against someone with lethal intent.

        Your next move should be to use non-lethal or less lethal devices, like stun batons, disablers, flashes, and flashbangs. Just make sure you get some training on these before trying to use them - offering them to a suspect in exchange for their cooperation is not an effective use of these tools.

        If you're lucky enough to run into a suspect who is a lethal threat, it's time to bust out all the goodies you've been hoarding from the armory.

        For an extra intimidation factor, take your robusted suspects to the medbay to be healed instead of the brig. That way, the whole crew can see just how robust you are.
