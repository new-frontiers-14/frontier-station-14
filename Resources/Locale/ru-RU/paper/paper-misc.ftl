book-text-plasma-trap = Heheheheh, no way in hell they're going to get at our stash NOW, is there?
      I rigged the area where our stuff's at to be a toasty thousand K.
      You know how to drain it when we need it out.

      At cybersun, we pride ourselves on cutting-edge military and industrial technology, and greatly appreciate your contribution to our establishment!
      Guardians are helpful and intelligent beings which nest within your body, completely immune to common hazards such as pressure, temperature and even bullets!
      You have purchased the holoparasite package, which contains a holoparasite activator, an instruction booklet, and our softcap merchandise.
      Instructions for use:
      1. Activate the holoparasite injector (preferably in a secluded area).
      2. Wait for the tingling and/or painful metaphysical sensation.
      3. Check your holoparasite for the ability to communicate and cooperate, and capacity to understand your orders.
      4. Use your recall-manifest ability to summon or recall the holoparasite back into your body.
      5. Keep the holoparasite within a short distance from yourself, otherwise it will be recalled by force!
      WARNING: Guardians are metaphysical beings, but draw from your HEALTH in order to exist. Direct damage done to guardians will be partially transferred to you!

      AME controller needs LV power and an HV wire to output to. Check the area with a crowbar if you aren't sure.
      There should be an empty room next to where you found this, that room's wired for the AME.
      You can put an AME anywhere if you can get the wires to it, though.
      3x3 grid of AME parts, multitool them to unpack. Be careful not to 'trap' anything.
      AME controller adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) to any point.
      With only 1 core (what a 3x3 grid will get you), don't turn it up above 2.
      The golden rule is 2 injection for every 1 core. You can go lower to save fuel.
      Higher will burn the engine out and eventually make it explode. Don't.
      Don't forget to refuel it, it tends to stop at the worst possible time.
