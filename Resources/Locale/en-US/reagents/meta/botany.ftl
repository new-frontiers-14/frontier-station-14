reagent-name-e-z-nutrient = EZ nutrient
reagent-desc-e-z-nutrient = Give your plants some of those EZ nutrients! Dionas find this delicious.

reagent-name-left4-zed = left-4-zed
reagent-desc-left4-zed = A cocktail of mutagenic compounds that gives nutrients, harms and affects plant life's genome.

reagent-name-pest-killer = pest killer
reagent-desc-pest-killer = A mixture that targets pests. While useful it slowly poisons plants with toxins, be careful when using it.

reagent-name-plant-b-gone = plant-B-gone
reagent-desc-plant-b-gone = A harmful toxic mixture to kill plantlife. Very effective against kudzu.

reagent-name-robust-harvest = robust harvest
reagent-desc-robust-harvest = A highly effective fertilizer, with a limited potency-boosting effect on plants. Be careful with it's usage since using too much has a chance to reduce the plant yield. It has a positive effect on dionas.
