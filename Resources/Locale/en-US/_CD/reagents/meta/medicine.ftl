reagent-name-serenitol = Serenitol
reagent-desc-serenitol = A fairly unreactive chemical that has mild antidepressant properties. Originally used to help patients overcome the loss of a pet or family friend, it is fairly safe to administer.

reagent-name-neurozenium = Neurozenium
reagent-desc-neurozenium = Once considered child-safe shoe polish, Neurozenium was found to be a fairly effective antidepressant in an impressive zero-to-hero story. Do not take it with alcohol in your system. Consult a doctor before combining with other medications.

reagent-name-blissifylovene = Blissifylovene
reagent-desc-blissifylovene = A military-grade antidepressant with a very low dosage. Very powerful, though it is often considered a last resort due to its interactions with other medications and psychosis-inducing overdoses. Addictive in all but the smallest of doses.

reagent-name-calmafluxine = Calmafluxine
reagent-desc-calmafluxine = A mild, over-the-counter anxiety medication. Commonly prescribed to children as the body naturally flushes out any excess medication, making overdose functionally impossible.

reagent-name-tranquinase = Tranquinase
reagent-desc-tranquinase = Run-of-the-mill anxiety medication. Derived from an old recipe for space bear tranquilizer, it causes tranquility and motivation. Causes intense grogginess during overdose. Do not take with alcohol.

reagent-name-equilibrazine = Equilibrazine
reagent-desc-equilibrazine = A Nanotrasen engineered chemical recipe designed to keep workers working with only small doses. It didn't make the cut, but it functions as a potent treatment for anxiety and panic attacks. Can be taken fine with alcohol, but is wildly incompatible with most antidepressants.

reagent-name-addictine = addictine
reagent-desc-addictine = A chemical produced by the body when metabolizing certain medications. Causes symptoms of withdrawl. Neutralizes bloodstream cleansers like charcoal and ipecac. 

reagent-name-stubantazine = Stubantazine
reagent-desc-stubantazine = A mild painkiller commonly used to treat brief stents of pain, though it lasts a little while for good measure. Overdose or consumption of alcohol may cause vomiting and digestion inefficiency.

reagent-name-soretizone = Soretizone
reagent-desc-soretizone = A fairly effective painkiller developed to treat chronic pain. It works for cases that Stubantazine won't solve. Overdoses will knock you right out. High doses may cause addiction. Does not conflict with reasonable amounts of alcohol.

reagent-name-agonolexyne = Agonolexyne
reagent-desc-agonolexyne = An incredibly potent and fast acting opioid invented to speed up the application of painkillers during surgery. Stops you from feeling pain (or really anything at all). Interacts poorly with alcohol. Known to be very addictive. Overdose may relax the lungs to the point of non-function.
