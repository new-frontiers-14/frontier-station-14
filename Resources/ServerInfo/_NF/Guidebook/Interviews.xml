  # Interviews

Latejoin slots on most ships can be joined as holograms (labelled as "Applicant").  Before joining as an actual player character, both the interviewer and interviewee must come to an agreement and approve of the terms.

As a hologram:
- You can [color=lightgreen]approve[/color] the terms through the [color=lawngreen]Approve[/color] action.
  -- Use the same action again to [color=olivedrab]rescind your approval[/color].
- You can [color=salmon]exit to the lobby[/color] through the [color=orange]paper on fire[/color] action.

As a crewmate:
- All verbs can be done by [bold]right-clicking[/bold] the ghost.
- [bold]You need to have the [color=dodgerblue]deed to a shuttle[/color][/bold] to [color=lightgreen]Approve[/color] a hologram.
  -- The [color=dodgerblue]deed[/color] is also required to [color=olivedrab]Rescind Approval[/color].
- [bold]Anyone[/bold] can [color=salmon]Dismiss[/color] the hologram (and optionally [color=orchid]close the slot[/color]).
