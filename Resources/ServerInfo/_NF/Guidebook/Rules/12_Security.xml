# 12. NFSD and Frontier Staff Standards

You must follow the law and be an example to the rest of the community when playing as security or station staff.

    - Security Forces (NFSD) and Frontier Staff roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay.
    -- These roles are considered as Nanotrasen employees and are strictly non-antagonists.
    -- Engaging in any antagonistic activities in these roles is strictly prohibited.
    -- Abuse of the equipment provided to work in these roles is strictly prohibited.
    - NFSD officers roleplaying as 'bad cops' and intentionally violating space law is forbidden.
    -- Space Law is not optional for these roles, and strong knowledge is required before taking a security position.
    - Both NFSD and Frontier Staff are expected to display reasonable levels of competence and performance on their jobs.
    - NFSD officers must follow NFSD Standard Operating Procedure (see Wiki in the menu for more details).
    - Assets seized from criminals may only be used to make victims whole and to pay for any fines under the law.
    -- Excess funds received from the sale of criminal assets are to be returned to their original owners.
    -- These assets are not to be plundered or embezzled by security forces.
    -- This is a strict zero-tolerance policy.
