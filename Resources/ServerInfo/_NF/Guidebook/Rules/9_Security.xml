# 9. Security and Station Standards

    - Security Forces and Station Staff roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay and are strictly non-antagonists.
    - Security Forces roleplaying as ‘bad cops’ and intentionally violating space law is forbidden. Space Law is not optional for these roles, and strong knowledge is required before taking a security position.
    - Civilian and Security staff are expected to maintain a minimum of competency and performance on their jobs. Security staff must follow NFSD Standard Operating Procedure (see Wiki in the menu for more details).
    - Assets seized from criminals may only be used to make victims whole and to pay for any fines under the law. Any excess financials received from the sale of criminal assets is to be returned to their original owners, and are not to be plundered or extorted by security forces. This is a strict zero-tolerance policy.
    - All players that are hired on as crew to the station as security or service staff, or through other direct jobs working for paychecks from the station, are considered non-antags and official Nanotrasen employees. Engaging in any hostile antagonistic activities, or abuse of the equipment provided while working in these roles, is strictly prohibited.
