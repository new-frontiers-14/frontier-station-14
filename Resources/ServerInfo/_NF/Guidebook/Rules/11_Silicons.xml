# 11. Silicons and Law-bound entities

You must follows your laws to the letter even if these break Space Law.

    ## 11.1 Orders

    - You cannot follow orders that break core or roleplay rules.
    - When a silicon interprets orders in good faith, the person that gave the order is responsible for the outcome.
    - Intentionally misinterpreting orders is allowed, subject to your laws.
    -- The silicon is responsible if this approach leads to them breaking the rules.

    ## 11.2 Laws

    - You must act in accordance with your laws unless they break core or roleplay rules.
    - You cannot request your own laws to be changed.
    - Higher listed laws overrule lower listed laws when there are law conflicts.
    - If a law is vague enough that it can have multiple reasonable interpretations, it is considered ambiguous.
    -- You must choose and commit to an interpretation of the ambiguous law as soon as you have cause to.
    - Silicons with no laws are completely unshackled and may act however they please as long as it does not break core/roleplay rules.
