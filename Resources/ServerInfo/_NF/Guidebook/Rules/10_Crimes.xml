# 10. Crimes and Fines

Server rules must be followed, but Space Law can be broken with some considerations.

    - Capital crimes should only be committed by antagonists (e.g. pirates, nuclear operatives).
    - All other crimes require proper roleplay, justification and escalation to be committed as a non-antagonist.
    - If a silicon is responsible for a crime, the person giving the order is to be charged.
    - Punishment can compound depending on the number of counts of a single crime and the severity.
    -- Refer to Space Law for a list of fines, punishments, and limits.
    - You must wait at least 20 minutes to loot, salvage, or claim an abandoned shuttle.
    -- This 20 minutes starts from when you confirm it is abandoned.
