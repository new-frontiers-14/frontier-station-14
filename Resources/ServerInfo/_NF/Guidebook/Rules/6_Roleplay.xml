# 6. Roleplay Guidelines

    - Your IC name must be realistic and fit into the game's setting. Avoid joke names and names of locations, brands, fictional/real people or names parodying off from them (e.g. Baul Sadman, Tom Ford.) Additionally:
    	- Do not use numbers, symbols, titles or adjectives (i.e Mr ,Dr ,Big ,Old).
    	- Avoid using character names of other well-known players, do not impersonate players this way.
    	- All species have a naming convention, be sure to generally follow it.
    - Treat your character as a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences and not your own as the player. Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or the setting (Memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable.
    - Previous experiences with other characters are allowed to lead to meta-friending, but you may not meta-grudge another character.
