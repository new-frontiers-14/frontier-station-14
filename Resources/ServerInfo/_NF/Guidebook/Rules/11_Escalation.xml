# 11. Escalation Guidelines

    - Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attack. Don't grief nanotrasen-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
    - Do not attack another player without a legitimate, explainable roleplay reason that could be applied in a similar, real-life scenario. A fistfight does not suddenly escalate into a gunfight.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured or killed, seek medical help for them.
    - If at any point combat is disengaged and both parties leave the area, you cannot skip escalation and plunge back into a fight. Whatâ€™s done is done.
    - Security Forces are expected to resolve situations with non-lethal force and to de-escalate IC confrontation except in cases where there is a reasonable chance of harm/death.
    - Do not End of Round Grief (EORG), attacking/killing/griefing other players is not permitted after the shift ends.
