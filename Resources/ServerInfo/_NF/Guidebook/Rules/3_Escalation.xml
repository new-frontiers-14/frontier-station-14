# 3. Escalation Guidelines

A fistfight does not suddenly escalate into a gunfight. Use common sense.

    - Antagonistic ghost roles and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attack. 
    - As a non-antagonist, don't attack Nanotrasen-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
    - Do not attack another player without a legitimate, explainable roleplay reason that could be applied in a similar, real-life scenario.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured or killed, seek medical help for them.
    - If a fight ends and both parties leave the area, you cannot skip escalation and plunge back into a fight. What's done is done.
    - A 15 minute non-aggression period is required after respawning, so you can't immediately get in a ship and try to go kill whoever killed you.
    - NFSD and command roles must resolve situations with non-lethal force and de-escalate IC confrontation except in cases where there is a reasonable chance of harm/death.
