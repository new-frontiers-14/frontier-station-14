# 7. Antagonism

Even bad guys follow their own rules.

    - When taking a ghost role, follow its set of rules unless told otherwise by an admin.
    -- Spamming ahelp asking for an exception will likely lead to a ban.
    -- Solo antags (e.g. space dragon) and free agents should not work with team antagonists (e.g. pirates).
    - Non-antagonists must not work with antagonists and vice-versa.
    - Antagonist roles are [bold]expected[/bold] to act hostile towards non-antagonists.
    -- Antagonists include xenomorphs, nuclear operatives, space dragons, zombies and pirates.
    - Free agents [bold]may[/bold] act hostile towards non-antagonists or not, at their discretion.
