# 13. Command Standards

You are the highest authority in the sector apart from Central Command. You must act as an example for the rest of the community.

    - Command roles (e.g. Station Rep, Sheriff) are held to a much higher standard of roleplay.
    - Command is [color=#ff0000]required[/color] to maintain pay for their respective staff as a part of their job.
    -- You are expected to maintain pay for roles absent other command positions, within reason.
    -- Minimum hourly pay rates are $10,000 for station crew, $20,000 for Station Rep and Sheriff, and $15,000 for security.
    -- Embezzlement of station funds is strictly forbidden.
    - If ending your shift early:
    -- Have your ID on your character.
    -- Reopen your position at the station records computer.
    -- Return to cryosleep.
    -- If you cannot (disconnect, crash, power outage, etc.), ping the game admins in Discord.
    - Command is expected to enforce docking laws and collect any fines related to dock loitering.
    -- Refer to Space Law for the specific laws on dock loitering.
    -- Funds collected from this may be used for station payroll or station supplies.
    -- Traffic to and from traffic-controlled stations should be kept flowing.
    - You may not tax, lease, rent, or otherwise impede the use of station resources. This includes:
    -- Charging docking fees.
    -- Granting docking extensions.
    -- Restricting vendor access (e.g. placing machines behind locked doors).
    -- Restricting access to station resources.
