# 12. PVP & Piracy Guidelines

    - Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members, including the Captain.
    - Non-hostile vessels that surrender: cannot be killed, left stranded, completely bankrupt, or otherwise. The safety of non-hostile merchant vessels is to be guaranteed by all parties. All vessels being boarded must first attempt to negotiate before any hostile actions may take place.
    - Hostile forces that are known, declared, and confirmed, may be considered 'belligerent', boarded non-conventionally, and have their systems disabled in attempts to bring them to justice. All suspects taken alive must be adequately cared for and unharmed according to Space Law.
