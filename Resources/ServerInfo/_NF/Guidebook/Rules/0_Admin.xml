# 0. Admin Rules

    - Admins can disregard any and all other rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.
        - They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.
    - All of these rules apply as they are intended.
        - Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.
    - Staff is not obligated to cover player losses, deaths or delays.
        - This includes but is not limited to ship deeds, money, respawns or revivals. Any action taken will depend on the circumstances at hand.
