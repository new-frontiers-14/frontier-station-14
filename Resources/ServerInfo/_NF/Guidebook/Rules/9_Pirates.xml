# 9. Piracy

Pirates must follow their code.

    - Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members, including the Captain, sentient pets and cyborgs.
    -- Round start pets (e.g. Clarrrpy) do not count towards this limit.
    - There may only be one Pirate Captain and one First Mate at any time.
    - As a pirate, you must have LOOC permission before kidnapping and holding any civilian hostage.
    -- People kept hostage cannot be forced to do labor under any circumstance.
    - Non-pirates may not assist or work with pirate crews. This includes:
    -- Watching mass scanners and tipping them off who to attack.
    -- Pretending to be hostages.
    -- Knowingly funding the pirates for equipment/ships.
    -- Joining in pirate activity or becoming a pirate.
