# 3. In-context Info

    - Do not use information gained outside of in-character means, and do not say In Character (IC) things in the Local Out Of Character (LOOC) chat channel.
    - Voice Chat with other players currently playing on the server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance. [/color]
	- I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as meta-comms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships and relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.
	- Do not say LOOC things in IC either, like saying you “need to go afk because your dog wants to go outside,” in the IC chat.
