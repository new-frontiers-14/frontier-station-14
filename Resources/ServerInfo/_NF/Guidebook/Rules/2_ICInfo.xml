# 2. In-context Info

Keep everything in the place it belongs. It hurts roleplay when your character starts talking about stuff they should not know.

## 2.1 IC/OC and Meta-friending

  - Do not use information gained outside of in-character means (e.g. as a ghost).
  - Do not say in character (IC) things in the local out of character (LOOC) chat channel.
  - Do not say LOOC things in IC, like saying you “need to go afk because your dog wants to go outside,” in the IC chat.
	- Characters can know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists.
  - Characters can keep persistent friendships and relationships with other characters, but this should develop through IC interaction.

## 2.2 Cloning and Revival

  - After cloning, respawning, or taking a ghost role, you must follow the new life rules:
  -- You can only recall vague details of who or what had killed you.
  -- You can remember everything that happened before being incapacitated.
  -- When taking a ghost role, you know [bold]nothing[/bold] about your previous characters while playing that role.
  - Do not respawn to avoid punishment from the NFSD, or respawn as the same character if given a permanent confinement sentence or execution.
  - Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted (see 2.1).
