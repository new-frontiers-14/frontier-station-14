# 4. Cloning, Revival, and Ghost Roles

    - After cloning, respawning, or taking a ghost role, you must follow the new life rule.
        - If cloned, resuscitated, or respawned, you don't have amnesia, but you can only recall vague details of who or what had killed you.
    - If taking a ghost role, you have no memories from any past lives for the duration of playing as a ghost role.
        - Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted.
    - A 15 minute non-aggression period is required after respawning, so you canâ€™t immediately get in a ship and try to go kill whoever killed you.
