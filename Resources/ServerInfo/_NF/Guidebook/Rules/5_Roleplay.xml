# 5. General Roleplay Guidelines

Your IC name must be reasonable and fit into the game's setting. This is a roleplay server first and foremost, so give your character the effort it deserves.

## 5.1 Naming

    - Avoid joke names and names of locations, brands, fictional/real people or names parodying them (e.g. Baul Sadman, Tom Ford.)
    - Do not use numbers, symbols, titles, adjectives or honorifics (i.e Mr, Dr, Big, Old).
    - Avoid using character names of other well-known players, do not impersonate players this way.
    - All species have a naming convention, be sure to generally follow it.

## 5.2 Meta/Chat

    - Treat your character as a separate entity from you, the player.
    -- Your character's actions and feelings in-game should be based solely on the experiences of the character, not you.
    - Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or the setting (memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable.
    - Do not use Netspeak when talking (i.e. LOL, ROFL, XD, FR).
