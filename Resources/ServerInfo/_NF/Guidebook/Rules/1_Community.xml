# 1. Community Expectations

Everyone here is playing to have a good time and have fun. Respect other players and treat them in the same way you would like to be treated.

## 1.1 Do not be a dick

    - Do not harass or be toxic other players.
    - Do not push political messages of any kind in chat, images, drawings or faxes.
    - Do not grief as a non-antagonist; this includes against AFK and SSD/catatonic players.

## 1.2 Do not powergame

  - It will be considered as displaying a consistent pattern of antisocial and unsporting behavior in which a player prioritizes their game experience at the expense of others through routine optimization and abuse of game mechanics/knowledge.
