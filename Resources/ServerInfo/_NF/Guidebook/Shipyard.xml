Shuttle insurance technology has been standardized to allow all citizens to purchase, pilot, and operate space-faring craft throughout the Frontier regions.

Purchasing a ship will register it onto a personal ID card inserted into the [color=#cccc00]Shipyard Console[/color].

This ID card can then be used to sell the ship back to the shipyard, for the resulting value of the ship.

Ships come fully equipped with the tools and supplies needed to perform at least one profitable task in the frontier.

Each ship will also come with additional crew roles and supplies to assist. Space is a dangerous place, and your chances of survival increase dramatically when you work as a team.
