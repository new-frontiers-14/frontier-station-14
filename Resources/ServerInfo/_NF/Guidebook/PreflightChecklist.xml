# Preflight Checklist and Troubleshooting

## 1. Power supply

## 1.1. Battery units
<Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
</Box>

- Check if the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
- Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).

For additional information consult [textlink="Powerstorage" link="PowerStorage"/].

## 1.2. Generator
<Box>

</Box>

- Check if the generator is anchored to the floor.
- Check if the generator has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
- Check if the generator is set to HV output.
- Start the generator unit.
- Set Target Power for the through power amount indicated by your substation.
- Power draw may seem excessively high while power storage systems recharge.

## 1.3. Solar panels

  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SolarTracker"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SolarPanel"/>
</Box>

- Inspect solar control computer.
- Adjust panel angular velocity.
- Adjust panel angle.
- There may be a slight lag period before power generation is reported.

## 2. Atmospherics

## 2.1. Distribution Loop
<Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OxygenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMixer"/>
</Box>

- Check that the oxygen and nitrogen canisters are anchored to the connector port.
- Check that the distribution mixer is set to 101kPa.
- Enable the distribution mixer.
- A standard gas mix is 79% nitrogen, 21% oxygen. Adjust for crew need.

## 3. Other checks
<Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
</Box>

- Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
- Gyroscopes can be powered down. If your gyroscope appears non functional ensure it has not been deactivated.
- Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
