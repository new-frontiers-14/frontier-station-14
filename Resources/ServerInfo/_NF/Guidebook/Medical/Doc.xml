  # Director of Care

  DoC shift objectives:

  1) Ensure the health and well-being of the sector's populace.

  2) Foster collaboration and coordinate efforts of medical teams where possible.

  3) Encourage medical mentorship, either personally, time permitting, or by finding appropriate placement for interns.

  4) Compensate medical teams for their work in assisting with the above three goals.

  ## Your Ledger

  To compensate medical teams and station staff you have been provided a discretionary fund.

  Nanotrasen is prepared to provide additional resources for the successful return of each medical bounty.

  ## The Medical Dispatch Center

  As a new DoC, the maintenance of the Medical Dispatch Center is one of your responsibilities. Consider hiring contractors as needed to ensure it is kept in good working order.

  The shift DoC is not expected to remain at the Medical Dispatch Center. You are encouraged to be present where needed and act in a capacity that best fulfills your primary goals.
