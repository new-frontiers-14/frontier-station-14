# Offshore Gas Mining
Asteroids in the Frontier sector are a reliable source of large amounts of normally gaseous elements in the form of [color=gold]solidified deposits[/color].

Atmospheric ships, for example, the [color=yellow]Gasbender[/color] and [color=yellow]Ambition[/color], come equipped with the equipment needed to extract from these deposits. Check for the [color=cyan]Atmospherics[/color] category at the [color=steelblue]shipyard console[/color] when buying ships.

## Needed Equipment

The equipment you'll need:
- A mining drill
- A portable gaslock
- Steel for pipes
- A source of power (J.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. recommended)
- LV cable
- A gas deposit scanner (optional)

## Mining Procedure

Standard procedure for drilling for gas is as follows:

1. Find an asteroid with [color=lightpink]gas deposits[/color] on it. A [color=lightgreen]gas deposit scanner[/color] can help you find these - it beeps when close to one. You can print one from an [color=orange]engineering techfab[/color].

2. Mine out some of the asteroid, and look for [color=lightpink]whisps of solid elements[/color].

3. Anchor your [color=khaki]gas mining drill[/color] onto the [color=lightpink]deposit[/color].

4. Build a [color=dodgerblue]set of pipes[/color] connecting the drill to the most convenient edge of the asteroid.

5. Make sure that your shuttle can dock with the edge. Constructing a [color=violet]lattice jetty[/color] can help.

6. Note: gas filters, mixers, scrubbers and vents [color=tomato][bold]may not work[/bold][/color] on the asteroid. For efficient processing, set up your shuttle for [bold]onboard filtration, processing and storage[/bold].

7. Anchor a [color=mediumspringgreen]portable gaslock[/color] onto the edge of the asteroid. Point the [bold]red outlet port[/bold] with the docking lights [bold]out[/bold] towards space.

8. Using the shuttle console, dock [color=cyan]your shuttle's gaslock[/color] with the [color=mediumspringgreen]portable gaslock[/color].

9. Anchor a [color=orange]portable generator[/color] on the asteroid, turn it on, and set up [color=limegreen]cables[/color] so both the [color=khaki]mining drill[/color] and [color=mediumspringgreen]portable gaslock[/color] are powered.

10. Set the target pressure on your [color=khaki]drill[/color].

11. Set the pressure and direction on both the [color=mediumspringgreen]portable gaslock[/color] and [color=cyan]your shuttle's gaslock[/color].

12. Note that the [color=mediumspringgreen]gaslocks[/color] are [bold]bidirectional[/bold], and the direction the lights are moving is the direction the gas will flow. [bold]Both should point in the same direction to pump gas.[/bold]

13. Wait until the [color=lightpink]gas deposit[/color] is depleted - the light on the miner should glow [color=yellow]yellow[/color] when low, and [color=red]red[/color] when empty. If you find other deposits on the same asteroid, [bold]it is efficient to pump multiple deposits at the same time![/bold]

14. If the miner glows [color=orange]orange[/color], your pipe network is backed up. Double check your pressures and pump directions!

## Gas Filtering and Processing

Gas deposits are impure, and [bold]should be filtered before selling[/bold]. [color=turquoise]Gas filters[/color] can help extract one gas at a time through their side port.

Different gases have different values. The most valuable gases are [color=lightskyblue]frezon[/color] followed by [color=limegreen]tritium[/color]. Ask someone who knows more about atmospherics about how to process plasma into tritium, and tritium into frezon.

Selling gas can be done through canisters, which can be crafted from plasteel, or in bulk at a [color=lightgreen]gas sale point[/color], e.g. at Edison Power Plant.

- Canisters can be sold using cargo pallets and cargo sales consoles, like any other good.
- [color=lightgreen]Gas sale points[/color] can accept massive amounts of gas at a time, and require gas to be pumped in through a gaslock.

Both sales methods pay according to the [bold]purity[/bold] of your mix. [bold]Be sure to filter your gas![/bold] The easier it is for NT to separate your gases out, the better the pay.

Best of luck out there, greenhorn, and keep at it.
