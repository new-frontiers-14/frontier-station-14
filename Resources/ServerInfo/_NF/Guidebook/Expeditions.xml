  Expeditions are adventures that you can go on with your crew.[br][/br]
Your ship will jump to a planet and you need to complete an objective in a limited time.[br][/br]
When that time runs out, the ship jumps back, [bold]whether you're on it or not[/bold].

Ships purchased at Frontier Outpost [bold]cannot[/bold] go on expedition, but [italic]any purchased at [bold]Expeditionary Lodge[/bold] can[/italic].
You will need to use the [color=#a4885c]salvage console[/color] onboard.

To go on an expedition:
- Pilot your ship so there is 200 m of empty space in each direction.
- Use the [color=#a4885c]salvage console[/color].
- Pick one of the five missions offered to you.
- Note the enemy, conditions, total time, and objectives for the mission.
- Buckle into a seat to avoid falling down.

Tips for expeditions:
- Start with easier missions and progress to harder ones as you get better equipped.
- Different enemy types have different strengths and weaknesses. Vary your loadout to best deal with each.
- If you don't think you can win a fight, don't take it.

When you arrive on-site, you'll be told which direction the objective is in.
There'll be a building in that direction; break in and complete your objective.
Note: North is towards the top of the screen in default rotation (NUMPAD 8).

While planetside, you can't communicate via radio with the wider Frontier Sector.
If you don't have a [color=#a4885c]telecommunication server[/color] on your ship, your headset won't work.
Note that [color=#a4885c]handheld radios[/color] work without a server.
