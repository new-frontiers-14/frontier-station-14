  Expeditions are adventures that you can do with your fellow crewmates or on your own. 

You must pick a mission from the [color=#a4885c]salvage console[/color], each of which of varying difficulty and reward.

When you chose a mission, provided there are no other shuttles or objects nearby, the ship will immediately FTL jump to the mission area, if not you will have to move the ship further away first.

Once you arrive, the chat will tell you which direction the target of the expedition is in.
  
While planetside you will be unable to communicate via radio with the wider Frontier Sector, and unless you have a [color=#a4885c]telecommunication server[/color] installed you won't be able to use radio to communicate with your crew in the expedition either.
