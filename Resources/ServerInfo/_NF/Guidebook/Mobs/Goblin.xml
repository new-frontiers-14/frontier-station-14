  Their small stature allows goblins to dive into toilets and mailing units. They don't like to be sprayed with water or space cleaner.
  
  When unarmed, their claws deal [color=red]Slash[/color] damage instead of Blunt.

  Due to their unusual dietary choices goblins take [color=lime]20% less Toxin damage[/color], but because of their small size they take [color=#ffa500]10% more Brute (Blunt/Slash/Piercing) damage[/color].
