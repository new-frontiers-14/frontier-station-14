  They can [color=#ffa500]only[/color] eat meat and fruits, but can eat raw meat and drink blood without any ill effects.

  Their small stature allows goblins to dive into toilets and mailing units. They don't like to be sprayed with water or space cleaner.
  
  Their unarmed attacks deal [color=red]Slash[/color] damage instead of Blunt.

  Due to their unusual dietary choices goblins take [color=lime]20% less Toxin damage[/color], but because of their small size they take [color=#ffa500]10% more Brute (Blunt/Slash/Piercing) damage[/color].
