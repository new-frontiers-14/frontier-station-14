  Sheleg are a race of ice-like humanoid beings possessing blue skin and white hair, with a strong Nordic culture.

  ## Diet
  - Normal medical chemicals have no effect, however cryo chemicals work with their cold body temperature.

  ## Benefits
  - Takes [color=#1e90ff]no Cold damage and 20% less Blunt, Slash and Piercing damage.[/color]
  - Due to their large size they can easily carry, shove and pull any other morphotypes.
  - They are harder to shove.
  - Being cold has no walking and running speed reductions.
  - As long as they are alive, they [color=#1e90ff]slowly passively heal heat damage.[/color]

  ## Special
  - They have a body temperature of -172 °C. This requires them to wear an EVA suit in standard station atmospheres and they always start the shift provided with one.
  - Cryoxadone blood.
  - Inhale oxygen and exhale water vapor.
  - Get hungry slower, but thirsty faster.
  - Have no floor friction with no shoes.
  - Bare-hand attacks deal Cold damage in addition to Blunt.

  ## Drawbacks
  - They are harder to carry and pull.
  - They are larger than humans, making them easier to hit.
  - They take [color=#ffa500]65% more Heat and 25% more Shock damage.[/color]
  - They take [color=#ffa500]high Heat damage above 0 °C body temperature.[/color]
  - They cannot be injected with syringes, hyposprays or darts due to their hardened skin.
  - Slow food and chemical metabolisation means that they can only process one chemical at a time.
  - They [color=#ffa500]react violently with potassium: touching it hurts, drinking it melts them.[/color]
