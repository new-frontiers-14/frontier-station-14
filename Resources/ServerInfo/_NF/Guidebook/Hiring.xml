  As the Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire and fire crew members, and to delegate work.
There are two ways to hire crew:
- Use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots. Players that join later can spawn in on your ship.
- Invite other players to join your crew through in-game communications.

Crew membership is informal - you don't need to sign any forms, but feel free to roleplay!
It's a good idea to make sure your crew understand:
- What you expect of them (What tasks should they do? Who do they report to or work with?)
- What they can expect from you (An hourly wage? A split of rewards? The promise of adventure?).

As a Captain, remember:
- You're responsible for the well-being of your crew.
- A Captain's only as good as their word!
