As the Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire and fire crew members, and to delegate work at will. There are two ways to hire crew:
- Use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots. Players that join later can spawn in on your ship.
- Invite other players to join your crew through in-game communications.

Crew membership is informally enforced - you don't need to sign any forms, but feel free to roleplay!
It's a good idea to make sure your crew understand:
- What you expect of them (Tasks to do)
- What they can expect from you (An hourly wage? A split of rewards? The promise of adventure?).

Remember, you're responsible for the well-being of your crew, and a captain's only as good as their word!
