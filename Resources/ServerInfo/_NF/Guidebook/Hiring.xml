  As the Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire and fire crew members, and to delegate work.
There are two ways to hire crew:
- Use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots. Players that join later can spawn in on your ship.
- Invite other players to join your crew through in-game communications.

Crew membership is informal - you don't need to sign any forms, though feel free to roleplay!

It's good to make sure your crew understand what you expect of them, and what they can expect from you,
be it an hourly wage, a split of future rewards, or just the promise of adventure.

As a Captain, remember:
- You're responsible for the well-being of your crew.
- A Captain's only as good as their word!
