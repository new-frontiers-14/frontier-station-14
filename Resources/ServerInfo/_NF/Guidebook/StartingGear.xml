  In the bag on your person you will find the following equipment:

  -A [color=#028ed9]survival box[/color], containing equipment to help you survive emergency scenarios
  -A [color=#CC6633]traffic control key[/color], which can be slotted into your radio headset to utilize the traffic control radio channel
  -A [color=#33bbff]medical implant[/color]. If you inject it, when you get incapacitated, it'll tell your location to medics. Click the implanter to equip it in your hand, and click it again to inject it into your body.

  Find your headset by opening your inventory (backpack icon, bottom left corner).

  Suit sensors give your vital status and position to anyone with a [color=#55bbff]crew monitoring console[/color], typically used by medical personnel.

  The sensor options are the following:

  -Off: Disables tracking - you will not be listed
  -Binary: Shows you as Alive or Dead with no position
  -Vitals: Shows your vital status (Good, Okay, Poor, Bad, Critical) with no position
  -Coordinates: Shows your vital status and current position on a crew monitor

  To change your suit sensors:

  -Right-click your jumpsuit
  -Hover over "Sensor >"
  -Left-click your new setting

  In general, set your sensors to Coordinates if you'd like medics to come get you in a crisis.
