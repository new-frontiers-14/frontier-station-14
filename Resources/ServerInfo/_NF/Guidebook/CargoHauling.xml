  # Cargo Hauling

One of the ways you can make money on the Frontier is by moving shipments of [color=peru]trading crates[/color].

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrateTradeSecureNormal"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrateTradeContrabandSecure1"/>
  </Box>

You can find these by:
  - Buying them at [color=peru]cargo request computers[/color] at the [color=forestgreen]Trade Outpost[/color]
  - Salvaging them from [color=#88b0d1]space wrecks[/color]
  - Finding [color=#c83737]contraband crates[/color] to be smuggled (ask around to find out how)

Each trading crate starts with a [bold]label[/bold] saying [bold]where the create is headed[/bold], and will have a [bold][color=orange]destination symbol[/color][/bold] on the right side of the crate. Examining the crate ([color=yellow]Shift+Click[/color]) shows the name of the station it should be delivered to.

[bold]Selling a crate at its destination[/bold] station will result in receiving [bold][color=lightgreen]more money[/color][/bold] than the crate is worth, while [bold]selling it at other stations[/bold] will result in [bold][color=lightpink]less money[/color][/bold].

## Express Deliveries

Some crates are labelled as [color=yellow]express deliveries[/color]. These provide a bonus if delivered [bolditalic]to the destination[/bolditalic] on time.

To make deliveries in time, make sure to keep your cargo bay organized so the crates for each destination can be removed from the cargo bay in order.

Remember, more hands make light work, so crew up to help deliveries run smoothly!

## Cargo Storage

One of the ways to store more trading crates on a ship at one time is by using [color=dodgerblue]crate storage racks[/color]. These racks take up only one tile, but can hold up to [bold][color=forestgreen]four[/color] trading crates at a time[/bold]!

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrateStorageRackFrame" Caption=""/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrateStorageRack" Caption=""/>
  </Box>

If your ship doesn't come with any, you can [bold][color=dodgerblue]construct these yourself![/color][/bold] You'll need a welder, a welding mask, some steel and some metal rods. All in all, each rack takes [bold]7 sheets of steel[/bold] to construct.

In order to insert or remove trading crates to a [color=dodgerblue]crate storage rack[/color], a [color=yellow]mech[/color] with a [color=yellow]power fork[/color] module [bolditalic]must be used[/bolditalic] with the rack.

Each power fork can hold up to four crates at a time. When picking crates up off the ground, a fork picks up one crate at a time. When inserting or removing crates from a [color=dodgerblue]crate storage rack[/color], the fork can completely fill or empty a rack if there's space.

### Cargo Mechs

To acquire a cargo mech:
- Buy a [color=yellow]Ripley[/color] from a scientist, ask them to put one or two power fork modules in it. Make sure to get a large battery!
- Buy an [color=orange]Emu[/color] from the cargo request consoles on the Trade Outpost for $10,000.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MechRipley"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MechEmu"/>
  </Box>

The [color=orange]Emu[/color] is [bold]fast[/bold], but has [bold]only one power fork[/bold].

The [color=yellow]Ripley[/color] is [bold]slower, upgradeable,[/bold] and has [bold]two slots for power forks[/bold].

Use this knowledge to help move freight faster. Good luck out there.
