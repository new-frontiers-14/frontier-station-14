  # Cargo Hauling

One of the ways you can make money on the Frontier is by moving shipments of [color=peru]trading crates[/color].

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrateTradeContrabandSecure1"/>
  </Box>

You can find these by:
  * Buying them at [color=peru]cargo request computers[/color] at the [color=darkgreen]Trade Outpost[/color]
  * Salvaging them from [color=#88b0d1]space wrecks[/color]
  * Finding [color=#c83737]contraband crates[/color] to be smuggled (ask around to find out how)

Each trading crate will have a destination symbol on the right side of the crate. Examining the crate (Shift+Click) shows the name of the station it should be delivered to.

Selling a crate at its destination station will result in receiving more money than the crate's worth, while selling it at other stations will result in less.

## Express Deliveries

Some crates are labelled as [color=yellow]express deliveries[/color].  These provide a bonus if delivered [italic]to the destination[/italic] on time.

To make deliveries in time, make sure to keep your cargo bay organized so the crates for each destination can be removed from the cargo bay in order.

Remember, more hands make light work, so crew up to help deliveries run smoothly!
