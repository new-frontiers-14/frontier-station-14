  # Smuggling Prevention

  As an officer in the NFSD, part of your job is to prevent smuggling.

  Smugglers use [color=#9ef5ff]dead drops[/color], objects where the Syndicate leaves notes with clues to the location of [color=#c4261d]drop pods[/color] filled with contraband.
  
  Remember: 
  - These are spread across the seedier points of interest across the sector.
  - Use any clue you might find lying around.
  - Ask around to see if the public's seen suspicious activity.
  - Be on the lookout for strange traffic patterns.

  As NFSD officers, part of your job is to prevent smuggling, and to catch smugglers in the act.
  
  Keep Nanotrasen's monopoly on commerce in the sector strong, for a secure future.

  ## Notifications

  When a note is taken from a [color=#9ef5ff]dead drop[/color], a [color=#c4261d]drop pod[/color] is teleported into the sector. This [color=#c4261d]drop pod[/color] contains cargo, some of it contraband, and these illicit goods tend to be sold for profit.

  With cutting-edge Nanotrasen bluespace technology, [bold]we can get signatures when these notes are taken[/bold], and, with some delay, get [bold]the approximate location of a [color=#c4261d]drop pod[/color][/bold].

  Due to the nature of bluespace, [bold]these notifications are not completely reliable[/bold], but that is no excuse for laziness. Remain vigilant.

  ## Forensics

  As an incentive to prevent smuggling and catch active smugglers, a [color=#5d8c45]contraband forensics module[/color] comes standard in a Detective's gear. [bold]Using these rewards your department for good field work[/bold].

  [color=#5d8c45]Scanning[/color] active or previously used [color=#9ef5ff]dead drops[/color], and Syndicate [color=#c4261d]drop pods[/color] credits the NFSD's bank with spesos and FUCs. FUCs will be paid out to the scanning officer when enough have been collected.

  [bold]You get bigger rewards by being the first to a [color=#9ef5ff]dead drop[/color], so get moving![/bold]
