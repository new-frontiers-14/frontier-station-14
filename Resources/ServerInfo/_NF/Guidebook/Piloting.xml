To move a shuttle, you first need to click on the [color=#a4885c]shuttle console[/color] in its cockpit. After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the space around your shuttle.

Newly purchased shuttles start docked with Frontier Outpost.  To undock, follow these steps:

- Tell people you are undocking using the traffic radio channel (:d).  Include your ship's callsign, which can be found on the NAV screen (e.g. "Pioneer NX-123 undocking.")
- Click on the DOCK tab, disconnect any airlocks that are docked to the station.
- Return to the NAV tab.

- To move a shuttle, the default controls (for a QWERTY keyboard) are:

-[color=#028ed9]W & S[/color]: Move forward and backward.
-[color=#028ed9]A & D[/color]: Move left and right.
-[color=#028ed9]Q & E[/color]: Rotate left and right.
-[color=#028ed9]Spacebar[/color]: Slow down.
-[color=#028ed9]Hold Spacebar + any input[/color]: Move and rotate slowly.

To dock your ship:
- First approach your destination.
- It is best practice to announce your intention to dock if you are docking with another ship, if you wish to dock to Frontier station you may have to request permission from the Station Traffic Controller (STC) over the traffic radio channel (:d).
- Align your ship's airlock with the airlock of the target.
- When very close, click on the docking tab for a closer view.
- When the airlock is alligned you will have the option to click "dock".
