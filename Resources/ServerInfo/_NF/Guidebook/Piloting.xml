  To move a shuttle, you first need to click on the [color=#a4885c]shuttle console[/color] in its cockpit. After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the space around your shuttle.

Newly purchased shuttles start docked with Frontier Outpost. To undock, follow these steps:

- Tell people you are undocking using the traffic radio channel (:d). Include your ship's callsign, which can be found on the NAV screen (e.g. "Pioneer NX-123 undocking.")
- Click on the DOCK tab, disconnect any airlocks that are docked to the station.
- Return to the NAV tab.

-[color=#028ed9]A & D[/color]: Move left and right.
