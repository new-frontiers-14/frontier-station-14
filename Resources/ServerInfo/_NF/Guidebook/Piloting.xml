To dock your ship:
- First approach your destination.
- It is best practice to announce your intention to dock if you are docking with another ship, if you wish to dock to Frontier station you may have to request permission from the Station Traffic Controller (STC) over the traffic radio channel (:d).
- Align your ship's airlock with the airlock of the target.
- When very close, click on the docking tab for a closer view.
- When the airlock is alligned you will have the option to click "dock".
