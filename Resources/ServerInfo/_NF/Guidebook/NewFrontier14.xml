  # NT New Frontiers Program

Thank you for signing up for the New Frontiers Program! As a Nanotrasen employee, you're helping to develop the furthest reaches of space!

[color=#33bbff]If you'd like a hand, ask on the radio, or talk to somebody.[/color]
The [color=#dd0000]Valet[/color] or [color=#009933]Station Representative[/color] should be able to help, they're to the right of medbay.

## Economy

  Any money that you make is [bold]yours[/bold], and will be available in future shifts if deposited at a [color=#44cc00]Galactic Bank ATM[/color] on Frontier Outpost or Tinnia's Rest.

To make money, why not:
- Join a ship's crew? Ask on the radio if anyone needs extra crew, and work to help your captain.
- Get a job on station? Ask the [color=#009933]Station Representative[/color] (follow the SR signs) if anything needs doing.
- Use a [color=#cccc00]shipyard console[/color] to purchase your own ship?

## Amenities

  Some provisions (e.g. air tanks, salvage equipment) are available from vendors on Frontier Outpost, but most amenities (medical services, food) should be offered by players on shuttles or at the Trade Depot.

Be sure to stock up at the Trade Depot if going out on an extended voyage, and take advantage of the [color=#33bbff]medical insurance tracker[/color] in your loadout, or from the NanoMed vendor in medbay.

Shifts on the Frontier typically last for [color=#33bbff]six hours[/color].
If you need to end your shift early or take a break, use the [color=#33bbff]cryo sleep chambers[/color] in the medbay on Frontier Outpost.
