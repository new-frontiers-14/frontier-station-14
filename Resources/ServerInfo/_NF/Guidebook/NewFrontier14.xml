NT has opened up back stock of many machine boards taken from excess station construction projects, along with many other amenities to assist in taming the frontier.

Frontier stations typically run longer shifts, so if you need to end early or take a break for a while, you can always return to a [color=##33bbff]Cryopod[/color] early.
