  # Piloting
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerShuttle"/>
  </Box>
  After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:

  - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  - Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.

  As a Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire, fire, demote, or promote crew members at will. There are two ways you as a Captain can go about hiring crew: you can either use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots (jobs available vary from ship to ship) or invite through in-game communications other players to your crew.

  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Harbormaster-class tugboats are equipped with a two APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodifued Harbormaster-class tugboat requires 30 kW of power to remain operational.
  
  ** - Harbormaster-class tugboats have higher power demand than single standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit can provide at optimal settings, however the ship comes equipped with two P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units, recommended target power output for each P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 16 kW.
