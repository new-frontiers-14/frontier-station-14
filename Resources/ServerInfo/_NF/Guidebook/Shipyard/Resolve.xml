  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST

  ## 1. Power supply
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationWallBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the SMES unit is anchored and operational.
  - Check that the wall-mounted substation unit is anchored and operational.
  - Check that each APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
  - Check each APC unit's current Load** (W).

  ## 1.2. S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorSuperPacman"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetUranium"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignRadiationMed"/>
  </Box>

  - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
  - Set Target Power for 30 [bold]k[/bold]W.
  - Start the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit.
  - Close radiation shielding.

  ## 2. Atmospherics
  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop

    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OxygenCanister"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMixer"/>
    </Box>

    - Check that the O2 canister is anchored to connector port.
    - Check that the N2 canister is anchored to connector port.
    - Check that the gas mixer is set to the correct mixing ratio (21% Oxygen, 79% Nitrogen).
    - Check that the gas mixer is set to 101.3kPa.
    - Check that the gas mixer is enabled.
	- Check that vents in each room are operational.

    ## 2.2. Waste Loops
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasVentScrubber"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
    </Box>

    - Check that scrubbers in each room are operational.
    - Set the Air Alarm in Reception to Filtering (Wide).
    - Set the Air Alarm in Medical to Filtering (Wide).

    ## 2.3. Cryo Loop
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CryoPod"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasThermoMachineFreezer"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasFilter"/>
    </Box>

    - Ensure that the CryoPod, gas pump, and freezer are anchored, powered, and disabled.
    - When enabling the CryoPod for use, first ensure the gas pump is enabled. Ensure that it is set to 101.3kPa.
    - After confirming the gas pump is enabled, enable the freezer. Wait a moment for the pod to get to temperature (140K by default).
    - Before use, verify that the CryoPod is at the appropriate pressure and temperature using a Gas Sensor.
    - (Optional) Enable the Gas Filter and verify its operational condition. Use this to filter respiration and any other unwanted gases from the network.
    - (Optional) When disabling machinery on the cryo loop, ensure the gas pump remains on, as the line will remain cold.

  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SmallGyroscope"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.

  ## Sidenotes

  * - NanoTrasen Civilian typically designates their ships as service vessels. Facets of the Resolve's ship design -- particularly the open plan layout of medical and the chemistry lab -- identify it as a food service prototype repurposed for medical. NC complied with all appropriate permits and signoff with command prior to deployment.

  ** - Resolve-class vessels are equipped with two APC units split across the fore and aft (read: front and back) of the ship, located in Medical and Reception. In some cases, these ensure redundant power; the medbay doors benefit from this, for example.
