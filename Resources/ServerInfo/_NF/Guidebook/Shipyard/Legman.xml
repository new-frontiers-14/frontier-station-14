  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Legman-class service ships are equipped with one APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodifued Legman-class ship requires 4.7 kW of power to remain operational.
  
  ** - Legman-class service ships have low power demand meaning that standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit's Target Power value can be lowered as low as 5 kW. Please note, that recommended Target Power value to avoid blackouts during Gravity Generator charging sequence is 6 kW.
