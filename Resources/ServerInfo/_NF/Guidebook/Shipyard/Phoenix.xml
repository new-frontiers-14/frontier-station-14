    # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
    
    ## 1. Power supply
    
    ## 1.1. Battery units
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
    </Box>
    
    - Check that the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
    - Check that the substation unit is anchored to the floor.
    - Check that the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
    - Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).
    
    ## 1.2. P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorPacmanShuttle"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetPlasma"/>
    </Box>
    
    - Check that the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units are anchored to the floor.
    - Check that the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units have fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
    - Check that the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units are set to HV output.
    - Set Target Power for 9-12** [bold]kW[/bold].
    - Ensure that P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units are enabled.
    
    ## 1.3. Solar panels
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerSolarControl"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SolarTracker"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SolarPanel"/>
    </Box>
    - Inspect solar control computer (located at shuttle cockpit).
    - Adjust panel angular velocity.
    - Adjust panel angle.
    
    ## 2. Atmospherics
    
    ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OxygenCanister"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMixer"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
    </Box>
    
    - Check that the O2 canister is anchored to connector port.
    - Check that the N2 canister is anchored to connector port.
    - Check that the gas mixer is set to the correct mixing ratio (21% Oxygen, 79% Nitrogen).
    - Check that the gas mixer is set to 101kPa.
    - Ensure that the gas mixer is enabled.
    
    ## 2.2. Waste Loop
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
    </Box>
      
    - Ensure that the waste loop pump is enabled.
    - Disable Auto Mode on any Air Alarms.
    - Set Air Alarms to Filtering (Wide).
    
    ## 3. Other checks
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
    </Box>
    
    - Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
    - Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
    
    ## Sidenotes
    
    * - Phoenix-class research ships are equipped a power monitoring console that be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. An unmodified Phoenix-class ship requires 24.5 kW of power to remain operational.
    
    ** - Phoenix-class research ships come equipped with additional solar panels that can provide up to 17.5 kW of power under ideal circumstances. Assuming that the solar array will provide a third of its maximum output power, recommended target power output for each P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 12 kW.
