  # GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE BODKIN

  - The consider using the blast doors at the rear of the vessel for boarding wrecks and asteroids. This is the quickest way to get your loot into the cargo bay!
  - The Bodkin comes with three hardsuits. Hire some people to work with you and make a team!
  - The Bodkin comes with a withdraw-only ATM so you can sell your salvage to others who might need it, such as scientists.
