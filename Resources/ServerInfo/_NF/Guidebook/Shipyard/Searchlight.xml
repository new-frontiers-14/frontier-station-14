  # Piloting
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerShuttle"/>
  </Box>
  After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:

  - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  - Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.

  As a Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire, fire, demote, or promote crew members at will. There are two ways you as a Captain can go about hiring crew: you can either use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots (jobs available vary from ship to ship) or invite through in-game communications other players to your crew.
  
  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
  
  ## 1. Power supply
  
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationWallBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check the substation unit.
  - Check if the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
  - Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).
  
  ## 1.2. P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorPacmanShuttle"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetPlasma"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check if the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
  - Set Target Power for 15-16** [bold]k[/bold]W.
  - Start the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit.
  
  ## 2. Atmospherics
  
  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the air canister is anchored to connector port.
  - Check if the distribution pump is set to normal pressure.
  - Enable the distribution pump.
  
  ## 2.2. Waste Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
  </Box>
    
  - Enable waste loop pump.
  - Disable Auto Mode on the Air Alarm in the Engine Room.
  - Set the Air Alarm in the Engine Room to Filtering (Wide).
  
  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BlastDoor"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check if the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check if blast doors are closed.
  
  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Searchlight-class medical ship are equipped with a single APC unit that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption (which for the unmodified ship is 14.7 kW). One can check the ship's total power consumption against the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output: to keep substation and APC fully charged, P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output should exceed APC's Load. Remember to check APC Load and adjust the generator unit Target Power after connecting new power-consuming machines.
  
  ** - Searchlight-class medical ship have average power demand meaning that standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit's Target Power value can be put at 15 kW. Please note, that recommended Target Power value to avoid blackouts during Gravity Generator charging sequence is 16 kW.
