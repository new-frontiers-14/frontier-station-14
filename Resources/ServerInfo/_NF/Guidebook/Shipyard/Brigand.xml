  # Piloting
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerShuttle"/>
  </Box>
  After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:

  - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  - Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.
  
  # Hiring crew
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerStationRecords"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingHeadsetGrey"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="IntercomCommon"/>
  </Box>
  As a Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire, fire, demote, or promote crew members at will. There are two ways you as a Captain can go about hiring crew: you can either use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots (jobs available vary from ship to ship) or invite through in-game communications other players to your crew.
  
  # Salvage expeditions
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerSalvageExpedition"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="TelecomServerFilledShuttle"/>
  </Box>
  Expeditions are adventures that you can do with your fellow crewmates or on your own. You must pick a mission from the [color=#a4885c]salvage console[/color], each of which of varying difficulty and reward, the FTL transition to the location will initiate immediately if your shuttle is far enough away from celestial bodies (other shuttles, asteroids, POIs, etc.). Once you arrive, the chat will tell you in which direction the target dungeon of the expedition is.
  
  While planetside you will be unable to communicate via radio with the wider Frontier Sector, and unless you have [color=#a4885c]telecommunication server[/color] installed you won't be able to use radio to communicate with your crew in the expedition too.
