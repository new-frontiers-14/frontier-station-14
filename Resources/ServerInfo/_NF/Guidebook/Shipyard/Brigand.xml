  # Tips on running LVHI Brigand shuttles
  - Optimal [bold]Target Power[/bold] (kW) for the generator unit is [color=#a4885c]35 [bold]kW[/bold][/color]. If you've added additional machines, check shuttle [bold]APC units[/bold] to monitor the shuttle's power draw and adjust the generator's [bold]Target Power[/bold] accordingly. For more general information on the power grid and other life support systems, refer to the [textlink="Power" link="Power"] guidebook article and the [textlink="Preflight Checklist" link="PreflightChecklist"/].
  - There are two buttons in the cockpit: the one with a yellow and black frame controls the window shutters. The button with the gray frame controls the mini anchor.
