  # GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE LYRAE

  - Customise your labs! The second lab is incomplete but is designed to be customisable for either an anomaly vessel or a second artifact analyser. 
  - Make use of the gas transfer systems in the labs to capture any valuable gases produced by artifacts.
  - The existing lattice and free space between the Lyrae's 'arms' are ideal space for storing artifacts or for expanding the ship itself.
  - Consider hiring a salvager to work with you for all your artifact and material needs!
  - The workshop has plenty of space for you to add new machines.
  - Remember to increase the power output of the generator as you install more machines!
