  "A medium botanical research biodome equipped with a non-standard atmospherics system capable of isolating and storing - but not processing gases produced by mutated plants."

  # Piloting
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerShuttle"/>
  </Box>
  After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:

  - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  - Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.
  
  # Hiring crew

  As a Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire, fire, demote, or promote crew members at will. There are two ways you as a Captain can go about hiring crew: you can either use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots (jobs available vary from ship to ship) or invite through in-game communications other players to your crew.

  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
  
  ## 1. Power supply
  
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>

  - Check if the substation unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if all APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
  - Check the current Load of all APC units* (W).

  ## 1.2. S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorSuperPacman"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetUranium"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignRadiationMed"/>
  </Box>

  - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
  - Set Target Power for 18 [bold]k[/bold]W.
  - Start the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit.

  ## 2. Atmospherics

  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OxygenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasFilterFlipped"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMixer"/>
  </Box>

  - Check if the O2 canister and N2 canister are anchored to their connector ports.
  - Check the air canister connection port, if required.**
  - Check if the gas mixer labelled "Air" has its mixing ratio and output pressure set correctly.
  - Find the gas filter labelled "Nitrogen" and set it to filter nitrogen.
  - Find the gas filter labelled "Oxygen" and set it to filter oxygen.
  - Enable the gas mixer labelled "Air".

  ## 2.2. Waste Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasValve"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasFilterFlipped"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasVolumePump"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="StorageCanister"/>
  </Box>

  The Akupara does not feature a standard waste loop: it is also capable of storing valuable waste gases. Waste pipes are denoted with an orange color.

  - Ensure you have enabled the distribution loop, as it is an integral part of the waste loop.***
  - Set all Air Alarms to Filtering (Wide).

  To purge waste gases without collecting them:
  - Open the manual valve labelled "Waste".

  To collect waste gases:
  - Keep the manual valve labelled "Waste" closed.
  - Ensure a storage canister is connected into the collection connector port.
  - Set the Gas Filter labelled "Waste" to the waste gas you wish to store.
  - Enable the volumetric gas pump labelled "Waste".
  - Monitor contents of storage canister. Replace storage canister as necessary.

  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  </Box>

  - Check if the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check if the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.

  ## Sidenotes

  * - Akupara-class vessels are equipped with three APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodified Akupara-class vessels require 18 kW of power to remain operational.

  ** - Since the Akupara's distribution loop uses a gas mixer, it does not need pre-mixed air for optimal atmospherics. However, it features a port to accept pre-mixed air.

  *** - The oxygen and nitrogen filters are critical in the event mutagenic experiments create plants that produce oxygen or nitrogen. Turning them on enables waste to pass through and enables configurating the scrubbers to handle unwanted overpressure.
