  # GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE CERES

  - The Ceres is designed for multi-person crews. Consider having a dedicated botanist to grow quality produce.
  - The mailing units are designed to safely and efficiently transport items between botany and kitchen. You can even send eggs without cracking them!
  - Customize the table and seating layout to suit your needs, and use the cutter machine for your favourite flooring.
  - For serving food to a larger party, the food carts in the service area may simplify transportation.
  - When parked, you can use the red-bordered button on the bridge to turn off thrusters and significantly reduce power use.
