  # GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE CERES

  - The Ceres is designed for multi-person crews. Consider having a dedicated botanist to grow quality produce.
  - Though unorthodox, the mailing units are designed to safely and efficiently transport produce from botany to kitchen. Make use of them!
  - Don't be afraid to adjust the table and seating layout to suit your needs.
  - For serving food to a larger party, the food carts in the service area may simplify transportation.
  - When parked, you can use the button on the bridge to turn off thrusters and significantly reduce power use.
