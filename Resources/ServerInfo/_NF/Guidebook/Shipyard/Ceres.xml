  # Piloting
  <Box>

  </Box>
  After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:

  - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  - Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.

  As a Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire, fire, demote, or promote crew members at will. There are two ways you as a Captain can go about hiring crew: you can either use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots (jobs available vary from ship to ship) or invite through in-game communications other players to your crew.

  # GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THE CERES

  - The Ceres is designed for multi-person crews. Consider having a dedicated botanist to grow quality produce.
  - Though unorthodox, the disposal units are designed to safely and efficiently transport produce from botany to kitchen. Make use of them!
  - Don't be afraid to adjust the table and seating layout to suit your needs.
  - For serving food to a larger party, the food carts in the freezer may simplify transportation.
