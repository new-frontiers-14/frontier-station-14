  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST

  ## 1. Power supply

  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the substation unit is anchored to the wall.
  - Check that the four APC units have their Main Breakers toggled on.
  - Check the APC units' current Load* (W).

  ## 1.2. S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorSuperPacman"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetUranium"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignRadiationMed"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
  - Check that target power is set to 30** [bold]kW[/bold].
  - Start S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit.

  ## 2. Atmospherics
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OxygenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMixer"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the O2 canister is anchored to connector port.
  - Check that the N2 canister is anchored to connector port.
  - Check that the gas mixer is set to the correct mixing ratio (21% Oxygen, 79% Nitrogen).
  - Check that the gas mixer is set to 101kPa.
  - Enable gas mixer.

  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.

  ## Sidenotes

  * - Crossroads-class service ships are equipped with four APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. One can check the ship's total power consumption against the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output: to keep SMES, substation, and APC fully charged, S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output should exceed APC's Load. Remember to check APC Load and adjust the generator unit Target Power after connecting new power-consuming machines.

  ** - Crossroads-class service ships can be run on standard S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit settings, but may need to be adjusted to higher outputs in emergencies such as gravity failure or prolonged power outages.
