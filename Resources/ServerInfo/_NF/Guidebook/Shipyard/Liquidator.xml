  # Piloting
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerShuttle"/>
  </Box>
  After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:

  - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  - Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.
  
  # Hiring crew

  As a Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire, fire, demote, or promote crew members at will. There are two ways you as a Captain can go about hiring crew: you can either use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots (jobs available vary from ship to ship) or invite through in-game communications other players to your crew.
  
  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
  
  ## 1. Power supply
  
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the substation unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
  - Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).
  
  ## 1.2. S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit

  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BlastDoor"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check if the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check if the blast doors are closed.
  
  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Liquidator-class service ships are equipped with a single APC unit that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. One can check the ship's total power consumption against the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output: to keep SMES, substation, and APC fully charged, S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output should exceed APC's Load. Remember to check APC Load and adjust the generator unit Target Power after connecting new power-consuming machines.
  
  ** - Liquidator-class service ships have higher power demand than standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit can provide at optimal settings, so the standard P.A.C.M.A.N. was replaced with S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N.: recommended Target Power value to avoid blackouts during Gravity Generator charging sequence is 19 kW. Furthermore, while the portable scrubber unit is online, changing the Target Power value to 20 kW might be advisable.
  
  Note: Without a working generator, fully charged battery units (SMES and substation) in unmodified Liquidator-class service ships can provide power for approximately 10 minutes before fully depleting their charge.
  
  Note: Additional generator units can be purchased at the Frontier Station.

  Note: Be sure to take all necessary protective measures when working with radioactive materials: use a radiation suit, engage internals, make sure to enable Geiger's counter, wash your hands after, and keep radiation shutters closed at all times.
