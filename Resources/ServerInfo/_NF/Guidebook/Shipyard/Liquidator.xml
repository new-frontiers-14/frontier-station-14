  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
  
  ## 1. Power supply
  
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the substation unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
  - Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).
  
  ## 1.2. S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorSuperPacman"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetUranium"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignRadiationMed"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check that the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
  - Set Target Power for 18-19** [bold]kW[/bold].

  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BlastDoor"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check that the blast doors are closed.
  
  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Liquidator-class service ships are equipped with a single APC unit that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. One can check the ship's total power consumption against the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output: to keep SMES, substation, and APC fully charged, S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit Target Power output should exceed APC's Load. Remember to check APC Load and adjust the generator unit Target Power after connecting new power-consuming machines.
  
  ** - Liquidator-class service ships have higher power demand than standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit can provide at optimal settings, so the standard P.A.C.M.A.N. was replaced with S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N.: recommended Target Power value to avoid blackouts during Gravity Generator charging sequence is 19 kW. Furthermore, while the portable scrubber unit is online, changing the Target Power value to 20 kW might be advisable.
  
  Note: Without a working generator, fully charged battery units (SMES and substation) in unmodified Liquidator-class service ships can provide power for approximately 10 minutes before fully depleting their charge.
  
  Note: Additional generator units can be purchased at the Frontier Station.

  Note: Be sure to take all necessary protective measures when working with radioactive materials: use a radiation suit, engage internals, make sure to enable Geiger's counter, wash your hands after, and keep radiation shutters closed at all times.
