# Shuttle Brief

"An absolutely tiny shuttle designed for rapid response search and rescue operations on a budget.

Much of the production cost for the spirit was reduced by repurposing the hull from an obsolete model of bomber, stripping out armor, weapons, and ancilliary equipment to make room for a medbay.

The shuttle retains its original thrusters but the lower mass results in improved manuvarability.

Unfortunately the Mod 6 thruster is several decades out of date, their performance on par with modern civillian thrusters, but some captains still prefer them due to the abundance of surplus parts."
