  An absolutely tiny shuttle designed for rapid response search and rescue operations on a budget.
  
  Much of the production cost for the spirit was reduced by repurposing the hull from an obsolete model of 
  bomber, stripping out armor, weapons, and ancilliary equipment to make room for a medbay.
  
  The shuttle retains its original thrusters but the lower mass results in improved manuvarability. 
  Unfortunately the Mod 6 thruster is several decades out of date, their performance on par with modern civillian thrusters, but some captains still prefer them due to the abundance of surplus parts.

  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
  
  ## 1. Power supply
  
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationWallBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>
  
    - Check that the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
    - Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).
  
  ## 1.2. P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorPacmanShuttle"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetPlasma"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check that the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
  - Set Target Power for 8** [bold]kW[/bold].
  - Start the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit.
  
  ## 2. Atmospherics
  
  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check that the air canister is anchored to connector port.
  - Check that the distribution pump is set to 101kPa (101kPa).
  - Enable the distribution pump.
  
  ## 2.2. Waste Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
  </Box>
    
  - Enable waste loop pump.
  - Disable Auto Mode on the Air Alarm in the Engine Room.
  - Set the Air Alarm in the Engine Room to Filtering (Wide).
    
  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Spirit-class SAR ships are equipped with a single APC unit that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption (which for the unmodified ship is 7.7 kW). To keep the substation and APC fully charged, the generator target power should exceed APC's Load, but by as little as possible to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. Remember to check the APC Load and adjust the generator unit's target power after adding or removing power-consuming machines.
  
  ** - Spirit-class S.A.R. ships have low power demand. A standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator's target power value can be set to 8 kW. Due to the low mass of the shuttle less power is needed to maintain inertial dampening and the artificial gravity field, 8kW is sufficient even when the gravity generator is spooling.
