    "Originally used as a small assault vessel by NT, the Responder later got decomissioned and donated as research material to NT Medical. It was later stripped of its plastanium shielding and weapon systems to be converted into a medical response shuttle. An additional fee of 1.913% will be charged on top of the 7% standard for ships for the processing and disposal of the old shielding."

    # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST

    ## 1. Power supply

    ## 1.1. Battery units
    <Box>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationWallBasic"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
    </Box>

    - Check that the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
    - Check the substation unit.
    - Check that the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
    - Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).

    ## 1.2. S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
    <Box>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorSuperPacman"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetUranium"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignRadiationMed"/>
    </Box>

   - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
   - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
   - Check if the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
   - Set Target Power for 16 [bold]k[/bold]W.
   - Start the S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit.

  ## 2. Atmospherics

  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
  <Box>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirCanister"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
    </Box>

    - Check that the air canisters are anchored to connector ports.
    - Check that the gas mixer is set to 101.3 kPa.
    - Check the distribution pump. Located on the deck of the engineering nacelle.

    ## 2.2. Waste Loop
    <Box>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
    </Box>

    - Check waste loop pump. Located on under the ChemVend, in the Medical Bay.
    - Set the Air Alarm in the Medbay to Filtering (Wide).

    ## 3. Other checks
    <Box>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
        <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BlastDoor"/>
    </Box>

    - Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
    - Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
    - Check that blast doors are closed.
    - Check that the shutters are closed.

    ## Sidenotes

    * - Responder-class medical response ships are equipped with a single APC unit that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption (which for the unmodified ship is 15.3 kW). To keep the substation and APC fully charged, the generator target power should exceed APC's Load, but by as little as possible to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. Remember to check the APC Load and adjust the generator unit's target power after adding or removing power-consuming machines.
