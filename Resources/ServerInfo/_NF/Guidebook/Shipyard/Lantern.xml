  # Piloting
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerShuttle"/>
  </Box>
  After clicking the shuttle console, you should see a radar view of the shuttle. Here are the steps for piloting the shuttle back and forth:

  - First, disconnect any airlocks that are connected to the dock.
  - Then, you actually get to pilot the shuttle. The controls are fairly simple, with [color=#028ed9]"W"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"S"[/color] being forward and backward, [color=#028ed9]"A"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"D"[/color] being left and right, and [color=#028ed9]"Q"[/color] and [color=#028ed9]"E"[/color] being rotating left and right; and [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] being the brake and moving precicely by holding the [color=#028ed9]"spacebar"[/color] while doing other inputs.

  As a Captain of a Nanotrasen vessel, you have the authority to hire, fire, demote, or promote crew members at will. There are two ways you as a Captain can go about hiring crew: you can either use the [color=#a4885c]station records computer[/color] on your ship to open crew slots (jobs available vary from ship to ship) or invite through in-game communications other players to your crew.
  
  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST
  
  ## 1. Power supply
  
  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the substation unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
  - Check the APC unit's current Load* (W).
  
  ## 1.2. P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PortableGeneratorPacmanShuttle"/>

  </Box>
  
  - Check if the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check if the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit has fuel. For extended flights make sure that you have enough fuel stockpiled to sustain prolonged power generation during flight.
  - Check if the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is set to HV output.
  - Set Target Power for 10-15** [bold]k[/bold]W.
  - Start the P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit.
  
  ## 1.3. Solar panels
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerSolarControl"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SolarTracker"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SolarPanel"/>
  </Box>
  - Inspect solar control computer (located at shuttle cockpit).
  - Adjust panel angular velocity.
  - Adjust panel angle.
  
  ## 2. Atmospherics
  
  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPort"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the air canister is anchored to connector port.
  - Check if the distribution pump is set to normal pressure.
  - Enable the distribution pump.
  
  ## 2.2. Waste Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
  </Box>
    
  - Enable waste loop pump.
  - Disable Auto Mode on the Air Alarm in the Engine Room.
  - Set the Air Alarm in the Engine Room to Filtering (Wide).
  
  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  </Box>
  
  - Check if the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check if the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  
  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Lantern-class service ships are equipped with a three APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodifued Lantern-class ship requires 22.5 kW of power to remain operational.
  
  ** - Lantern-class service ships have higher power demand than standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit can provide at optimal settings, however the ship comes equipped with 38 solar panels that can provide up to 28.5 kW of power under the ideal circumstances: assuming that on average properly maintained solar array will provide one third of maximum output power, recommended target power output for P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 14 kW.
