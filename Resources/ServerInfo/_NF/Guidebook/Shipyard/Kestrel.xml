  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Kestrel-class salvage ships are equipped with five APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodifued Kestrel-class ship requires 27.6 kW of power to remain operational.
  
  ** - Kestrel-class salvage ships have higher power demand than single standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit can provide at optimal settings, however the ship comes equipped with two P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units, recommended target power output for each P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 15 kW.
