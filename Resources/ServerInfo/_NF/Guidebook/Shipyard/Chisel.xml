  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Chisel-class salvage ships are equipped with a single APC unit that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodified Chisel-class ship requires 19.6 kW of power to remain operational.
  
  ** - Chisel-class salvage ships have higher power demand than single standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit can provide at optimal settings, however the ship comes equipped with two P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units, recommended target power output for each P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 10 kW.
