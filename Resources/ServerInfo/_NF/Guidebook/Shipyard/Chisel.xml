  # Tips on running ICR Chisel shuttles
  - Optimal Target Power (kW) for S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 24 [bold]kW[/bold]. If you've added additional machines, check APC unit to see shuttle's power draw and adjust generator Target Power accordingly. For more general info on power grid see guidebook article [textlink="Power" link="Power"].
  - There is a conveyor belt line running under material processing machines in the shuttle's aft area. One can use the table to dump the contents of their ore bags and then activate the belt via a nearby lever.
  - For basics of shuttle piloting see [textlink="Piloting" link="Piloting"].
