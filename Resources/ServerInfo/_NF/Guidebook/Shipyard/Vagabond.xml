  ## Sidenotes
  
  * - Vagabond-class cargo ships are equipped with five APC units that can be used to appraise the ship's total power consumption. Unmodified Vagabond-class ship requires 24.6 kW of power to remain operational.
  
  ** - Vagabond-class cargo ships have higher power demand than single standard P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit can provide at optimal settings, however the ship comes equipped with two P.A.C.M.A.N. generator units, recommended target power output for each P.A.C.M.A.N. generator unit is 13 kW.
