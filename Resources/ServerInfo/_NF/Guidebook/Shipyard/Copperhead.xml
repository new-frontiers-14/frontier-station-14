  "Copperhead is an affordable, versatile, small shuttle with room for customization optimized for mining and salvage missions. Whether operating within a fleet or autonomously, its design is a compromise between speed, which is important for medium- to long-distance travel, and maneuverability, which is crucial for navigating asteroid fields. Manufactured by Langstad-Voigt Heavy Industries."
