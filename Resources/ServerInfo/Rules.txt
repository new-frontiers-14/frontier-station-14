[color=#ff0000]You must be 17 or older to play. Users under 17 will be banned immediately.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]Frontier Station is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job as a station or ship crew member and delegating tasks that are outside of that description, or striking out upon space as a Captain of your ship. This does not imply you’re forced to play the whole round; Frontier Station is designed with pop-in-and-out gameplay in mind, where some players will come and go but their bank account remains persistent across server restarts.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.
	- They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]0.1.[/color] All of these rules apply as they are intended.
	- Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP), erotic content, or 18+ sexual content is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color].

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Follow the community expectations. This includes both in game and elsewhere in our community.
	- Don't be a dick nor harass other players.
	- Do not evade bans.
	- Don't be racist or bigoted.
	- Do not attempt to cause lag to the server.
	- Do not grief as a non-antagonist; this includes against AFK and SSD/Catatonic Players.
	- Do not leave the server to avoid punishment from Admin staff.
	- Do not respawn to avoid punishment from Security Forces, or respawn as the same character if given a permanent confinement sentence.
	- Exploits, abusing bugs, cheating, power-gaming, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Do not use information gained outside of in-character means, and do not say In Character (IC) things in the Local Out Of Character (LOOC) chat channel.
	- I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as meta-comms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships and relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.
	- Do not say LOOC things in IC either, like saying you “need to go afk because your dog wants to go outside,” in the IC chat.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] After cloning, respawning, or taking a ghost role, you must follow the new life rule.
	- If cloned, resuscitated, or respawned, you don't have amnesia, but you can only recall vague details of who or what had killed you.
	- If taking a ghost role, you have no memories from any past lives for the duration of playing as a ghost role.
	- A 15 minute non-aggression period is required after respawning, so you can’t immediately get in a ship and try to go kill whoever killed you.
	- Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Follow Chat Guidelines
	- Only speak in English.
	- Do not spam.
	- Do not advertise.
	- Do not use Netspeak (i.e. LOL, ROFL, XD, FR).
	- Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color]. Words that are closely tied to, or intended to replace/imitate, real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Follow Roleplay Guidelines
	- Your IC name must be realistic. Avoid joke names and names of fictional or real people, or names playing off of them (e.g. Saul Badman.) Additionally, avoid using the character names of other well-known players, you may not impersonate other players this way. (e.g. Bill Carson.) If your species has a naming convention, be sure to generally follow it.
	- Treat your character as a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences and not your own as the player. Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or the setting (Memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable.
	- Previous experiences with other characters are allowed to lead to meta-friending, but you may not meta-grudge another character.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Follow Antagonist Guidelines
	- All ghost roles have a set description for how the role should be played, you must follow the ghost role description unless told otherwise by an admin. Spamming ahelp asking for an exception will likely lead to being banned.
	- Antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and sometimes wizards are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs, nuclear operatives, space dragons, or zombies.
	- Non-pirates may not assist or work with pirate crews, examples are such as watching mass scanners and tipping them off who to attack, pretending to be hostages, or knowingly funding the pirates for equipment/ships.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Security Forces and Station Staff roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay and are strictly non-antagonists.
	- Security Forces roleplaying as ‘bad cops’ and intentionally violating space law is forbidden. Space Law is not optional for these roles, and strong knowledge is required before taking a security position.
	- Assets seized from criminals may only be used to make victims whole and to pay for any fines under the law. Any excess financials received from the sale of criminal assets is to be returned to their original owners, and are not to be plundered or extorted by security forces. This is a strict zero-tolerance policy.
	- All players that are hired on as crew to the station as security or service staff, or through other direct jobs working for paychecks from the station, are considered non-antags and official Nanotrasen employees. Engaging in any hostile antagonistic activities, or abuse of the equipment provided while working in these roles, is strictly prohibited.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Sector Command roles such as HoP and HoS are vital to the operation of the sector and are held to a much higher degree of roleplay and role handling.
	- Sector Command is expected and [color=#ff0000]required[/color] to maintain pay for their respective staff as a part of their job. Payroll should be a minimum of 10,000 for station crew, 20,000 for Station Rep and Sheriff, and 15,000 for security per hour. Embezzlement of station funds is strictly forbidden.
	- Both of these roles have higher access to station resources than should be allowed for most crew members. As such, if you must ever end your shift early, always bring your ID with you, and always return to cryosleep so that your access cannot be stolen and the station funds embezzled. If for any reason you cannot (disconnect, crash, power outage, etc.) Please ping the game admins in Discord and we will handle your in-game character accordingly.
	- Sector Command is permitted and expected to issue and enforce any docking fines related to loitering in the terminal for shuttles that have been idle for more than 10 minutes in the station docks without a valid reason, up to and including forced eviction of shuttles.  Fines collected in this way are permitted to be used as payroll or the acquisition of station supplies. Time spent docked and waiting at the station is to be kept at a minimum.
	- You may not tax, lease, rent, or otherwise reserve the free and fair usage of station resources to the detriment of the public. That includes but not limited to, charging docking fees, basic cloning services, vending access, and moving station resources behind access locked doors to restrict access, etc.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Follow Escalation Guidelines
	- Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attack. Don't grief nanotrasen-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
	- Do not attack another player without a legitimate, explainable roleplay reason that could be applied in a similar, real-life scenario. A fistfight does not suddenly escalate into a gunfight.
	- If a fight results in someone being critically injured or killed, seek medical help for them.
	- If at any point combat is disengaged and both parties leave the area, you cannot skip escalation and plunge back into a fight. What’s done is done.
	- Security Forces are expected to resolve situations with non-lethal force and to de-escalate IC confrontation except in cases where there is a reasonable chance of harm/death.
	- Do not End of Round Grief (EORG), attacking/killing/griefing other players is not permitted after the shift ends.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Follow PVP & Piracy Guidelines
	- Pirates/antagonists must ahelp before starting a crew and receive permission to begin antag activity. When permitted, admins will announce to all ships via. fax that a ship has gone rogue. Spamming ahelp asking to be a pirate or pirating without permission will likely lead to being banned.
	- The immediate 200 meters around the Frontier and the Frontier itself is considered a safe zone and absolutely no antag activity or griefing is permitted within that zone. This includes but is not limited to destruction, modification, removal, or otherwise restriction of use of any machine or device designed for public use, and the structure of the station itself. For any non-antagonistic or roleplay modifications of the station, HoP's approval is always required.
	- Pirate actions may not begin on the Frontier. This includes stowing away while at the Frontier with intentions to steal the ship, outright stealing the ship or its cargo from the dock, selling someone else’s ship you hadn’t pirated outside the safe zone, or joining the crew under false pretenses with the intention to mutiny and take the ship.
	- Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members, including the Captain.
	- Non-hostile vessels that surrender: cannot be killed, left stranded, completely bankrupt, or otherwise. The safety of non-hostile merchant vessels is to be guaranteed by all parties. All vessels being boarded must first attempt to negotiate before any hostile actions may take place.
	- Hostile forces that are known, declared, and confirmed, may be considered 'belligerent', boarded non-conventionally, and have their systems disabled in attempts to bring them to justice. All suspects taken alive must be adequately cared for and unharmed according to Space Law.
