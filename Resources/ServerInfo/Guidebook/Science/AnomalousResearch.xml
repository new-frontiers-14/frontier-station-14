# Anomalous Research

Anomalous Research is a subdepartment of Science focused around the containment and manipulation of various unique anomalies.

## Equipment

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AnomalyScanner"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MachineAnomalyVessel"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MachineAPE"/>
</Box>

Scanners, vessels, and A.P.E.s are all used in the containment and observation of anomalies.

The anomaly generator can produce a random anomaly somewhere on the station at the cost of bananium.

## Anomalies
Anomalies are static objects that appear on the station. They cannot be moved, and must be worked around, no matter their location.

Each anomaly has three main stats, two of which can be seen in anomaly scans:

- [color=#a4885c]Severity:[/color] This is a numerical value corresponding to the danger of an anomaly.
- [color=#a4885c]Stability:[/color] Shown as either decaying, stable, or growing; this is how frequently and widespread the effects will be.
- [color=#a4885c]Health:[/color] Health is a hidden stat. It decreases when you use [color=#a4885c]containment particles[/color] on an anomaly. If you use too many, the anomaly will disappear.

## Pulses and Supercritical Events
The most dangerous effects of anomalies are seen during [color=#a4885c]pulses[/color] and [color=#a4885c]supercritical events[/color].

Pulses are semi-regular bursts of anomalous effects. They're moderately dangerous, scaling with both the severity and stability of an anomaly.

Supercritical events are only seen if an anomaly reaches 100% severity. If this happens, the anomaly will swell before disappearing into a catastrophic event. These should be avoided at all costs!
