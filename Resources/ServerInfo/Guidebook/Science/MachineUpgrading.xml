You can examine each machine part to see both the type and the rating, which range from 1 to 4.

Parts of higher levels can be researched as well as found through artifacts or salvage.

Machine Parts can be used to create many machines.

## Upgrading
To know if a machine can be upgraded, you can examine it and check for the [color=#a4885c]lightning bolt[/color] icon in the lower right corner. Clicking on it will allow you to see what kinds of upgrades the machine has.

To check what parts a machine needs, you can examine its board. Try it here:

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CloningPodMachineCircuitboard"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ThermomachineFreezerMachineCircuitBoard"/>
</Box>
You can use any rating part for any part requirement. Using higher rated parts will increase how effective the machine is.

If you want to upgrade an existing machine, simply deconstruct it with a screwdriver and crowbar, and replace the existing parts with parts of a higher level.

You can also quickly upgrade machines by using an RPED, loading it with machine parts, and then clicking on a machine. It will quickly be upgraded with whatever parts were inserted.
