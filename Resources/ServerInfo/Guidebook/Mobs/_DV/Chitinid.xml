  An industrious hymenoptera species, the Chitinid are strong and diligent. Thanks to evolution, they have grown an acute resistance to radiation, but not without its side effects.

  ## Diet
  - Can eat raw meat.

  ## Benefits
  - Takes 80% less Radiation, 10% less Slash Blunt and Piercing.
  - Their bodies naturally recover from light radiation damage up to a point, once they accumulate enough radiation they must purge it from their systems in the form of a small rock [color=#ff0f0f]WARNING:The Chitzite they expel is slightly radioactive [/color].
  - They are better at pulling and carrying things.
  - They possess a bio light.

  ## Drawbacks
  - They take 15% more Shock damage due to their biology.
  - Due to their hard shells normal syringes can not pierce them, requiring hypos to bypass the toughness.
  - Thanks to their overactive systems they get hungry 33% faster.
  - The cold does not agree with their biology and makes their movement sluggish the colder it gets, the cold also harms them more than others causing them to take 25% more damage from it.
  - They are deceptively heavy due to their lifestyle and diet.
  - Bug Blood.
