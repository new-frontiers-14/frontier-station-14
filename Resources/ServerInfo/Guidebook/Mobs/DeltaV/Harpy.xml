  An avian humanoid species that features colorful feathered wings and tails that can mimic almost any sound.

  They are quite sensitive to the air quality, and when exposed to low quality air, they will begin to visibly gasp, and eventually start choking.
  When this happens, a Harpy should either move away from sources of bad air, stand on top of a scrubber for a few seconds, or take a few breaths from a pure oxygen tank in order to restore their blood-oxygen levels. Only three seconds of being on pure oxygen is enough to completely restore a Harpy's blood oxygen saturation.

  ## Diet

  - Can eat raw meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Somewhat smaller than Humans, although not as small as Felinids
  - Uses their talons to deal Piercing damage
  - Can imitate around 70% of the game's sound library through a huge list of voice emotes
  - They can "Sing" midis by imitating instruments. Right click yourself to select an instrument
  - Moves 10% faster than other species.

  ## Special

  - Comes with the Ultraviolet Vision trait by default. This can be disabled via accessibility options.
  - Cannot wear Jumpsuits, and will automatically start with a Jumpskirt instead.
  - While singing, musical notes appear floating around their head.

  ## Drawbacks

  - Takes 15% more Blunt, Slash, and Piercing damage.
  - Extreme low density, Harpies are lighter than even Felinids, and weigh half as much as a Human.
  - A Harpy breathes in air twice as often as Humans, inhaling and exhaling every 3 seconds.
  - - Air tanks last half as long and Harpies are more susceptible than usual to low air quality.
  - - If a Harpy is exposed to at least 0.2 moles of combined CO2 and/or Miasma, they start struggling to take in oxygen.
