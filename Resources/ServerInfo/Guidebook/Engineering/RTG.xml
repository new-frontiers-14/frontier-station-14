Making power using a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) is similar to making power using solar.
RTGs only provide 10 kW of power, but they provide it for free and for the entire round.
Basically, if you connect an RTG to your power grid, it'll give you free power.

Sometimes, RTGs are damaged.
Damaged RTGs behave just like regular ones, but they're radioactive.
That means they're more dangerous, but on the bright side, you can put radiation collectors next to them to turn that radiation into more power.
