# Antimatter Engine (AME)

The AME is one of the simplest engines available. You put together the multi-tile structure, stick some fuel into it, and you're all set. This doesn't mean it isn't potentially dangerous with overheating though.

## Construction

To assemble an AME, start by wrenching down the controller on the far end of a HV wire. On most stations, there's catwalks to assist with this. From there, start putting down a 3x3 or larger square of AME parts in preparation for construction, making sure to maximize the number of "center" pieces that are surrounded on all 8 sides.

Once this is done, you can use a multitool to convert each AME part into shielding, which should form a finished AME configuration. From there, insert a fuel jar, set the fuel rate to [color=#a4885c]twice the core count or less[/color], and turn on injection.

## Fuel Economy
The closer you are to the perfect ratio of [color=#a4885c]1:2[/color] (1 AME core to 2 fuel rate) the more efficient you'll be. You're cutting fuel efficiency to [color=#a4885c]50% and less[/color] if you're using more cores, but less fuel injection rate.
For an example [color=#76db91]3 core and 6 fuel rate[/color] will generate [color=#76db91]240kW[/color], while [color=#f0684d]8 core 8 fuel rate[/color] will generate [color=#f0684d]160kW[/color]. Generating 80kW less while spending 2 more fuel each injection.

## Upgrading the AME

You can generally only upgrade the AME by getting more cores, which can be done by ordering more AME packages from [color=#a4885c]cargo[/color].
