  [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color] are chosen at the start of the shift and are tasked with taking over the station by killing or exiling all of the Command staff. Head Revolutionaries will be given a [color=#a4885c]Flash[/color] and a pair of [color=#a4885c]Sunglasses[/color] to aid them.

  ## Conversion

  You can convert crew members by using a [color=#a4885c]Flash[/color] in [color=#ff0000]harm mode[/color] and attacking someone with it. Any flash can be used for conversion, but remember that flashes have limited charges.

  However, things such as [color=#a4885c]Sunglasses[/color] and [color=#a4885c]Welding Masks[/color] offer flash protection and people wearing these will not be able to be converted.

  While not flash protection, a [color=#a4885c]MindShield Implant[/color] will prevent the implanted person from being converted into a revolutionary. Assume all of [color=#a4885c]Security[/color] and [color=#a4885c]Command[/color] are implanted already.

  ## Revolutionary

  A [color=#ff0000]Revolutionary[/color] is the result of being converted by a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color]. Revolutionaries are underlings of the Head Revolutionaries and should follow orders given by them and prioritize their well-being over anything else because if they die you will lose.
  Keep in mind that you can't convert others as a regular revolutionary, only your boss can do that.

  ## Objectives

  You must eliminate or exile all of the following Command staff on station in no particular order.
  - Captain
  - Head of Personnel
  - Chief Engineer
  - Research Director
  - Quartermaster
  - Head of Security
  - Chief Medical Officer

  Remember, your objective is to take over the station and not to destroy it so try to minimize damage where possible. Viva la revoluci√≥n!
