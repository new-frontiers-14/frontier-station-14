# Cloning
If all else fails, patients will need to be cloned. This should only be used as a last resort, if recovery is impossible. This is most often the case when the body has started to rot, or if they have excessive amounts of damage.

Cloning itself is relatively simple. (Assuming the network is set.) Just drag a body into the scanner, check the cloning console, and clone! If they've taken cellular damage, or have rotted for too long, the results can be... less than pleasant.

As a note: Cloning isn't always available, and it would be best not to rely on it.

## Biomass
Creating a clone requires biomass, which, gruesomely, involves recycling organic material. Be it crew members without a soul, station pets, or hostile creatures that have been 'taken care of', things can often be recycled.

Dragging a body onto the biomass reclaimer (with your cursor) will mulch it for re-use. If it's a crew member, it's common practice to strip the body and return departmental gear before doing such.
