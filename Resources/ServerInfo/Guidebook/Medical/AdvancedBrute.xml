  # Specialized Brute Chemicals

  Nanotrasen's greatest scientists have synthesized three more specific brute chemicals! Each one heals a specific damage subtype.

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Lacerinol"/>

  # Razorium

  [color=red]USE CAUTION[/color] when using the aforementioned specialized brute chemicals. Should one mix together with a different type of brute chemical, the resulting mixture will create a dangerous chemical known as Razorium!
  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Razorium"/>
  To avoid this, make sure the patient is done metabolizing one brute medication before giving them another. Keep an eye on the rate their health is changing.

  [bold]Some examples of mixtures that create Razorium are as follows:[/bold]

  Bicaridine and Puncturase

  Puncturase and Lacerinol

  Bruizine and Bicaridine

  Lacerinol and Bruizine

  Please note that [bold]any[/bold] combination of these 4 chemicals will likely mix and create Razorium! Be careful when creating these chemicals, as they contain Bicaridine. Any leftover Bicaridine will likely mix to create Razorium!
