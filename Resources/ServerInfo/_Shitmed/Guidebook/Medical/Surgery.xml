# Surgery
Your usual weekly activity. By performing surgical operations on your patients, you can heal wounds, remove or add body parts, organs, and more.

## The Basics
To start surgery your patient needs to be laying down, and ideally sedated.

If they are not sedated, they will be in a lot of pain, which decreases their mood, and will make surgical wounds worse.

You also need to wear protective gear such as a mask and gloves to prevent harming the patient due to contamination.

Once you've got tools in hand, interact with your patient to begin surgery. You'll be able to choose which part you want to operate on.
