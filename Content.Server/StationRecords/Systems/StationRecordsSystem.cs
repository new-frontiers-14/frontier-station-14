///     to lose the item that holds the key under any circumstance.
///
///     Records are mostly a roleplaying tool, but can have some
///     functionality as well (i.e., security records indicating that
///     a specific person holding an ID card with a linked key is
///     currently under warrant, showing a crew manifest with user
///     settable, custom titles).
///
///     General records are tied into this system, as most crewmembers
///     should have a general record - and most systems should probably
///     depend on this general record being created. This is subject
///     to change.
