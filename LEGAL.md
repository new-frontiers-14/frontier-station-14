## Definitions

Namespace refers to a subdirectory beginning with `_` indicating the authorship of its contents.

Code refers to any C# source code files and compiled assemblies, YML files in `Resources` and any scripts these may require such as the `Tools` subdirectory.

## Copyright

This means they remain at liberty to contribute their work anywhere they please.

## Code license

The project as a whole is licensed under the terms of the [AGPLv3](https://github.com/new-frontiers-14/frontier-station-14/blob/master/LICENSE-AGPLv3.txt) and must be followed regardless of parent licenses.

Where code from other authors is used, you must follow the terms of both the AGPLv3 and their license as given in the Attributions table below. Copyright information for all AGPLv3-licensed code is listed in [COPYRIGHT-AGPLv3.txt](https://github.com/new-frontiers-14/frontier-station-14/blob/master/COPYRIGHT-AGPLv3.txt).

Code created by Frontier contributors is found in _NF Namespaces.

Upstream code from [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) was taken under [the MIT license](https://github.com/new-frontiers-14/frontier-station-14/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT.txt). Any code not in a specific Namespace, excluding Nyanotrasen subdirectories, is sublicensed as MIT plus AGPLv3 from the Space Wizards Federation.
